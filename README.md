# 📚 AI Book & Research Paper Recommender

![Project Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML-Content--Based-blue) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-green) ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-API-red) ![DVC](https://img.shields.io/badge/DVC-Versioning-orange)

A **content-based recommendation system** that suggests top **books and research papers** based on user queries.
The project integrates multiple components — **data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, and recommendation** — into a reproducible pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project helps users discover relevant academic and technical resources by leveraging **semantic similarity** between user queries and textual data from books and papers.

* 📘 **Book data** fetched from **Google Books API**
* 📄 **Research paper data** fetched from **Semantic Scholar API**
* 🧠 Uses **Sentence Transformers** to compute semantic embeddings
* ⚙️ Implements **data version control (DVC)** for reproducibility
* 🐳 Deployable using **Docker**, compatible with **Vercel / Render**
* 💾 Pipelines for ingestion, cleaning, feature building, and model inference

---

## 🧩 Features

* 🔎 Recommend **top N books and papers** for any query (AI, ML, NLP, or Electronics-related).
* 🧠 **Sentence Transformer embeddings** for deep semantic understanding.
* 🧾 Metadata-aware ranking using title, authors, publisher, year, and citations.
* ⚡ **FastAPI-based backend** and **responsive web frontend** (HTML + TailwindCSS).
* 🔄 **DVC-tracked pipelines** ensure reproducibility of every experiment stage.
* 🧱 **Modular architecture** for extending recommendation logic or adding new models easily.
* 📦 **Config-driven pipeline** (YAML-based) for flexible experimentation.

## 🧠 Approach to Solution

1. **Data Ingestion** – Collected raw data from **Google Books API** and **Semantic Scholar API** for AI, ML, NLP, and Electronics-related topics.
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaned and standardized metadata (author, publisher, descriptions). Unknown fields were labeled as `"Unknown"`.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Combined textual data (title, author, abstract, description) into a single representation.
4. **Embeddings** – Generated high-dimensional embeddings using **Sentence Transformers** to capture semantic meaning.
5. **Similarity Computation** – Calculated **cosine similarity** between user query embeddings and resource embeddings.
6. **Ranking & Recommendation** – Returned top N matches sorted by similarity scores.
7. **Versioning & Reproducibility** – Managed datasets, intermediate files, and trained models using **DVC**.
8. **Deployment** – Containerized the FastAPI app with **Docker**, ready for deployment on **Vercel/Render**.
