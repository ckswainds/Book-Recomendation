classification,The 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System: a summary.,"The fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS), published in 2021, is the sixth version of the international standard for the classification of brain and spinal cord tumors. Building on the 2016 updated fourth edition and the work of the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy, the 2021 fifth edition introduces major changes that advance the role of molecular diagnostics in CNS tumor classification. At the same time, it remains wedded to other established approaches to tumor diagnosis such as histology and immunohistochemistry. In doing so, the fifth edition establishes some different approaches to both CNS tumor nomenclature and grading and it emphasizes the importance of integrated diagnoses and layered reports. New tumor types and subtypes are introduced, some based on novel diagnostic technologies such as DNA methylome profiling. The present review summarizes the major general changes in the 2021 fifth edition classification and the specific changes in each taxonomic category. It is hoped that this summary provides an overview to facilitate more in-depth exploration of the entire fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System.","D.

classification,The advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over F1 score and accuracy in binary classification evaluation,"To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.","D.

classification,PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation,"Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.","C.

classification,XNOR-Net: ImageNet Classification Using Binary Convolutional Neural Networks,"We propose two efficient approximations to standard convolutional neural networks: Binary-Weight-Networks and XNOR-Networks. In Binary-Weight-Networks, the filters are approximated with binary values resulting in 32\(\times \) memory saving. In XNOR-Networks, both the filters and the input to convolutional layers are binary. XNOR-Networks approximate convolutions using primarily binary operations. This results in 58\(\times \) faster convolutional operations (in terms of number of the high precision operations) and 32\(\times \) memory savings. XNOR-Nets offer the possibility of running state-of-the-art networks on CPUs (rather than GPUs) in real-time. Our binary networks are simple, accurate, efficient, and work on challenging visual tasks. We evaluate our approach on the ImageNet classification task. The classification accuracy with a Binary-Weight-Network version of AlexNet is the same as the full-precision AlexNet. We compare our method with recent network binarization methods, BinaryConnect and BinaryNets, and outperform these methods by large margins on ImageNet, more than \(16\,\%\) in top-1 accuracy.

classification,Optimizing taxonomic classification of marker-gene amplicon sequences with QIIME 2’s q2-feature-classifier plugin,"Taxonomic classification of marker-gene sequences is an important step in microbiome analysis. We present q2-feature-classifier (https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier), a QIIME 2 plugin containing several novel machine-learning and alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated and optimized several commonly used classification methods implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were evaluated in this work. These evaluations, based on 19 mock communities and error-free sequence simulations, including classification of simulated “novel” marker-gene sequences, are available in our extensible benchmarking framework, tax-credit (https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit-data). Our results illustrate the importance of parameter tuning for optimizing classifier performance, and we make recommendations regarding parameter choices for these classifiers under a range of standard operating conditions. q2-feature-classifier and tax-credit are both free, open-source, BSD-licensed packages available on GitHub.","Nicholas A.

classification,Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification,"Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66% [33]).

classification,ILAE classification of the epilepsies: Position paper of the ILAE Commission for Classification and Terminology,"The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of the Epilepsies has been updated to reflect our gain in understanding of the epilepsies and their underlying mechanisms following the major scientific advances that have taken place since the last ratified classification in 1989. As a critical tool for the practicing clinician, epilepsy classification must be relevant and dynamic to changes in thinking, yet robust and translatable to all areas of the globe. Its primary purpose is for diagnosis of patients, but it is also critical for epilepsy research, development of antiepileptic therapies, and communication around the world. The new classification originates from a draft document submitted for public comments in 2013, which was revised to incorporate extensive feedback from the international epilepsy community over several rounds of consultation. It presents three levels, starting with seizure type, where it assumes that the patient is having epileptic seizures as defined by the new 2017 ILAE Seizure Classification. After diagnosis of the seizure type, the next step is diagnosis of epilepsy type, including focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, combined generalized, and focal epilepsy, and also an unknown epilepsy group. The third level is that of epilepsy syndrome, where a specific syndromic diagnosis can be made. The new classification incorporates etiology along each stage, emphasizing the need to consider etiology at each step of diagnosis, as it often carries significant treatment implications. Etiology is broken into six subgroups, selected because of their potential therapeutic consequences. New terminology is introduced such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The term benign is replaced by the terms self‐limited and pharmacoresponsive, to be used where appropriate. It is hoped that this new framework will assist in improving epilepsy care and research in the 21st century.","I. Scheffer, S. Berkovic, G. Capovilla, M. Connolly, J. French, L. Guilhoto, E.

This paper summarizes the new WHO classification scheme for myeloid and histiocytic/dendritic neoplasms and provides an overview of the principles and rationale underpinning changes from the prior edition. The definition and diagnosis of disease types continues to be based on multiple clinicopathologic parameters, but with refinement of diagnostic criteria and emphasis on therapeutically and/or prognostically actionable biomarkers. While a genetic basis for defining diseases is sought where possible, the classification strives to keep practical worldwide applicability in perspective. The result is an enhanced, contemporary, evidence-based classification of myeloid and histiocytic/dendritic neoplasms, rooted in molecular biology and an organizational structure that permits future scalability as new discoveries continue to inexorably inform future editions.","J.

We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, and introduce techniques that are key for fine-tuning a language model. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24% on the majority of datasets.

classification,Köppen's climate classification map for Brazil,"Koppen's climate classification remains the most widely used system by geographical and climatological societies across the world, with well recognized simple rules and climate symbol letters. In Brazil, climatology has been studied for more than 140 years, and among the many proposed methods Koppen 0 s system remains as the most utilized. Considering Koppen's climate classification importance for Brazil (geography, biology, ecology, meteorology, hydrology, agronomy, forestry and environmental sciences), we developed a geographical information system to identify Koppen's climate types based on monthly temperature and rainfall data from 2,950 weather stations. Temperature maps were spatially described using multivariate equations that took into account the geographical coordinates and altitude; and the map resolution (100 m) was similar to the digital elevation model derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Patterns of rainfall were interpolated using kriging, with the same resolution of temperature maps. The final climate map obtained for Brazil (851,487,700 ha) has a high spatial resolution (1 ha) which allows to observe the climatic variations at the landscape level. The results are presented as maps, graphs, diagrams and tables, allowing users to interpret the occurrence of climate types in Brazil. The zones and climate types are referenced to the most important mountains, plateaus and depressions, geographical landmarks, rivers and watersheds and major cities across the country making the information accessible to all levels of users. The climate map not only showed that the A, B and C zones represent approximately 81%, 5% and 14% of the country but also allowed the identification of Koppen's climates types never reported before in Brazil.","C.

classification,Defining Training and Performance Caliber: A Participant Classification Framework.,"Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term ""elite"" subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.","Alannah K A McKay, T.

classification,Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation,"Modern approaches typically formulate semantic segmentation as a per-pixel classification task, while instance-level segmentation is handled with an alternative mask classification. Our key insight: mask classification is sufficiently general to solve both semantic- and instance-level segmentation tasks in a unified manner using the exact same model, loss, and training procedure. Following this observation, we propose MaskFormer, a simple mask classification model which predicts a set of binary masks, each associated with a single global class label prediction. Overall, the proposed mask classification-based method simplifies the landscape of effective approaches to semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks and shows excellent empirical results. In particular, we observe that MaskFormer outperforms per-pixel classification baselines when the number of classes is large. Our mask classification-based method outperforms both current state-of-the-art semantic (55.6 mIoU on ADE20K) and panoptic segmentation (52.7 PQ on COCO) models.","Bowen Cheng, A.

We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image. The first one generates an image, which maximises the class score [Erhan et al., 2009], thus visualising the notion of the class, captured by a ConvNet. The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets.

classification,"International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemia: Integrating Morphological, Clinical, and Genomic Data.","The classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias was last updated in 2016 within a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), the Society for Hematopathology, and the European Association for Haematopathology. This collaboration was primarily based on input from a clinical advisory committees (CAC) composed of pathologists, hematologists, oncologists, geneticists, and bioinformaticians from around the world. The recent advances in our understanding of the biology of hematologic malignancies, the experience with the use of the 2016 WHO classification in clinical practice, and the results of clinical trials have indicated the need for further revising and updating the classification. As a continuation of this CAC-based process, the authors, a group with expertise in the clinical, pathologic and genetic aspects of these disorders, developed the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Using a multiparameter approach, the main objective of the consensus process was the definition of real disease entities, including the introduction of new entities and refined criteria for existing diagnostic categories, based on accumulated data. The ICC is aimed at facilitating diagnosis and prognostication of these neoplasms, improving treatment of affected patients, and allowing the design of innovative clinical trials.","D. Arber, A.

classification,Haemodynamic definitions and updated clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension,"Since the 1st World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) in 1973, pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been arbitrarily defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg at rest, measured by right heart catheterisation. Recent data from normal subjects has shown that normal mPAP was 14.0±3.3 mmHg. Two standard deviations above this mean value would suggest mPAP >20 mmHg as above the upper limit of normal (above the 97.5th percentile). This definition is no longer arbitrary, but based on a scientific approach. However, this abnormal elevation of mPAP is not sufficient to define pulmonary vascular disease as it can be due to an increase in cardiac output or pulmonary arterial wedge pressure. Thus, this 6th WSPH Task Force proposes to include pulmonary vascular resistance ≥3 Wood Units in the definition of all forms of pre-capillary PH associated with mPAP >20 mmHg. Prospective trials are required to determine whether this PH population might benefit from specific management. Regarding clinical classification, the main Task Force changes were the inclusion in group 1 of a subgroup “pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) long-term responders to calcium channel blockers”, due to the specific prognostic and management of these patients, and a subgroup “PAH with overt features of venous/capillaries (pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis) involvement”, due to evidence suggesting a continuum between arterial, capillary and vein involvement in PAH.

classification,Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus,"DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF DIABETES MELLITUS — Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of differentorgans, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the -cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia. Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome. Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes. The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below). In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load. The degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process (Fig. 1). A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia. The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucoselowering agents. These individuals therefore do not require insulin. Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it. Individuals with extensive -cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same. Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself.",V.

classification,Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification,"Abstract. Although now over 100 years old, the classification of climate originally formulated by Wladimir Koppen and modified by his collaborators and successors, is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Koppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Koppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1°×0.1° grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Koppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5%, Tropical savannah).

classification,Deep learning for time series classification: a review,"Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.","Hassan Ismail Fawaz, G. Forestier, J. Weber, L.

On robustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0% to 83.7%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces ImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2. To achieve this result, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled ImageNet images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels on 300M unlabeled images. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by putting back the student as the teacher. During the generation of the pseudo labels, the teacher is not noised so that the pseudo labels are as accurate as possible. However, during the learning of the student, we inject noise such as dropout, stochastic depth and data augmentation via RandAugment to the student so that the student generalizes better than the teacher.","Qizhe Xie, E.

classification,Residual Attention Network for Image Classification,"In this work, we propose Residual Attention Network, a convolutional neural network using attention mechanism which can incorporate with state-of-art feed forward network architecture in an end-to-end training fashion. Our Residual Attention Network is built by stacking Attention Modules which generate attention-aware features. The attention-aware features from different modules change adaptively as layers going deeper. Inside each Attention Module, bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is used to unfold the feedforward and feedback attention process into a single feedforward process. Importantly, we propose attention residual learning to train very deep Residual Attention Networks which can be easily scaled up to hundreds of layers. Extensive analyses are conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to verify the effectiveness of every module mentioned above. Our Residual Attention Network achieves state-of-the-art object recognition performance on three benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 (3.90% error), CIFAR-100 (20.45% error) and ImageNet (4.8% single model and single crop, top-5 error).

Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization.

While significant progress has been made, the growing complexity of network designs, meta-learning algorithms, and differences in implementation details make a fair comparison difficult. In this paper, we present 1) a consistent comparative analysis of several representative few-shot classification algorithms, with results showing that deeper backbones significantly reduce the performance differences among methods on datasets with limited domain differences, 2) a modified baseline method that surprisingly achieves competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art on both the \miniI and the CUB datasets, and 3) a new experimental setting for evaluating the cross-domain generalization ability for few-shot classification algorithms. Our results reveal that reducing intra-class variation is an important factor when the feature backbone is shallow, but not as critical when using deeper backbones. In a realistic cross-domain evaluation setting, we show that a baseline method with a standard fine-tuning practice compares favorably against other state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms.","Wei-Yu Chen, Yen-Cheng Liu, Z.

classification,Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied to Unsupervised Classification of Reviews,"This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., ""subtle nuances"") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., ""very cavalier""). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word ""excellent"" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word ""poor"". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations).

classification,Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification: Benchmark and State of the Art,"Remote sensing image scene classification plays an important role in a wide range of applications and hence has been receiving remarkable attention. During the past years, significant efforts have been made to develop various data sets or present a variety of approaches for scene classification from remote sensing images. However, a systematic review of the literature concerning data sets and methods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all existing data sets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of scene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and diversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the development of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This paper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we propose a large-scale data set, termed “NWPU-RESISC45,” which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This data set contains 31 500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class.

classification,Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification,"Text classification is an important and classical problem in natural language processing. There have been a number of studies that applied convolutional neural networks (convolution on regular grid, e.g., sequence) to classification. However, only a limited number of studies have explored the more flexible graph convolutional neural networks (convolution on non-grid, e.g., arbitrary graph) for the task. In this work, we propose to use graph convolutional networks for text classification. We build a single text graph for a corpus based on word co-occurrence and document word relations, then learn a Text Graph Convolutional Network (Text GCN) for the corpus. Our Text GCN is initialized with one-hot representation for word and document, it then jointly learns the embeddings for both words and documents, as supervised by the known class labels for documents. Our experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that a vanilla Text GCN without any external word embeddings or knowledge outperforms state-of-the-art methods for text classification. On the other hand, Text GCN also learns predictive word and document embeddings. In addition, experimental results show that the improvement of Text GCN over state-of-the-art comparison methods become more prominent as we lower the percentage of training data, suggesting the robustness of Text GCN to less training data in text classification.","Liang Yao, Chengsheng Mao, Yuan Luo",2018.0,1905,AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6017e81c5ede6c38b306a3df9738aeb04baa7619,0.9520000000000017,0.015480253534861044,classification graph convolutional networks for text classification text classification is an important and classical problem in natural language processing there have been a number of studies that applied convolutional neural networks convolution on regular grid eg sequence to classification however only a limited number of studies have explored the more flexible graph convolutional neural networks convolution on nongrid eg arbitrary graph for the task in this work we propose to use graph convolutional networks for text classification we build a single text graph for a corpus based on word cooccurrence and document word relations then learn a text graph convolutional network text gcn for the corpus our text gcn is initialized with onehot representation for word and document it then jointly learns the embeddings for both words and documents as supervised by the known class labels for documents our experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that a vanilla text gcn without any external word embeddings or knowledge outperforms stateoftheart methods for text classification on the other hand text gcn also learns predictive word and document embeddings in addition experimental results show that the improvement of text gcn over stateoftheart comparison methods become more prominent as we lower the percentage of training data suggesting the robustness of text gcn to less training data in text classification liang yao chengsheng mao yuan luo

classification,An End-to-End Deep Learning Architecture for Graph Classification,"
 
 Neural networks are typically designed to deal with data in tensor forms. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture accepting graphs of arbitrary structure. Given a dataset containing graphs in the form of (G,y) where G is a graph and y is its class, we aim to develop neural networks that read the graphs directly and learn a classification function. There are two main challenges: 1) how to extract useful features characterizing the rich information encoded in a graph for classification purpose, and 2) how to sequentially read a graph in a meaningful and consistent order. To address the first challenge, we design a localized graph convolution model and show its connection with two graph kernels. To address the second challenge, we design a novel SortPooling layer which sorts graph vertices in a consistent order so that traditional neural networks can be trained on the graphs. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other graph neural network methods. Moreover, the architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based training with original graphs, without the need to first transform graphs into vectors.

classification,Chronic pain as a symptom or a disease: the IASP Classification of Chronic Pain for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11),"Abstract Chronic pain is a major source of suffering. It interferes with daily functioning and often is accompanied by distress. Yet, in the International Classification of Diseases, chronic pain diagnoses are not represented systematically. The lack of appropriate codes renders accurate epidemiological investigations difficult and impedes health policy decisions regarding chronic pain such as adequate financing of access to multimodal pain management. In cooperation with the WHO, an IASP Working Group has developed a classification system that is applicable in a wide range of contexts, including pain medicine, primary care, and low-resource environments. Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months. In chronic pain syndromes, pain can be the sole or a leading complaint and requires special treatment and care. In conditions such as fibromyalgia or nonspecific low-back pain, chronic pain may be conceived as a disease in its own right; in our proposal, we call this subgroup “chronic primary pain.” In 6 other subgroups, pain is secondary to an underlying disease: chronic cancer-related pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic secondary visceral pain, chronic posttraumatic and postsurgical pain, chronic secondary headache and orofacial pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. These conditions are summarized as “chronic secondary pain” where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom. Implementation of these codes in the upcoming 11th edition of International Classification of Diseases will lead to improved classification and diagnostic coding, thereby advancing the recognition of chronic pain as a health condition in its own right.","R.

regression,Generalized Intersection Over Union: A Metric and a Loss for Bounding Box Regression,"Intersection over Union (IoU) is the most popular evaluation metric used in the object detection benchmarks. However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric.

regression,Distance-IoU Loss: Faster and Better Learning for Bounding Box Regression,"Bounding box regression is the crucial step in object detection. In existing methods, while ℓn-norm loss is widely adopted for bounding box regression, it is not tailored to the evaluation metric, i.e., Intersection over Union (IoU). Recently, IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been proposed to benefit the IoU metric, but still suffer from the problems of slow convergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper, we propose a Distance-IoU (DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box and the target box, which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU losses. Furthermore, this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding box regression, i.e., overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio, based on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed, thereby leading to faster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU losses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, e.g., YOLO v3, SSD and Faster R-CNN, we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU metric but also GIoU metric. Moreover, DIoU can be easily adopted into non-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion, further boosting performance improvement.

regression,Mendelian randomization with invalid instruments: effect estimation and bias detection through Egger regression,"Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy). Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples. Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.","J. Bowden, G. Davey Smith, S.

regression,"The coefficient of determination R-squared is more informative than SMAPE, MAE, MAPE, MSE and RMSE in regression analysis evaluation","Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.","D. Chicco, M.

regression,Deep Ordinal Regression Network for Monocular Depth Estimation,"Monocular depth estimation, which plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene geometry, is an ill-posed problem. Recent methods have gained significant improvement by exploring image-level information and hierarchical features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These methods model depth estimation as a regression problem and train the regression networks by minimizing mean squared error, which suffers from slow convergence and unsatisfactory local solutions. Besides, existing depth estimation networks employ repeated spatial pooling operations, resulting in undesirable low-resolution feature maps. To obtain high-resolution depth maps, skip-connections or multilayer deconvolution networks are required, which complicates network training and consumes much more computations. To eliminate or at least largely reduce these problems, we introduce a spacing-increasing discretization (SID) strategy to discretize depth and recast depth network learning as an ordinal regression problem. By training the network using an ordinary regression loss, our method achieves much higher accuracy and faster convergence in synch. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-scale network structure which avoids unnecessary spatial pooling and captures multi-scale information in parallel. The proposed deep ordinal regression network (DORN) achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., KITTI [16], Make3D [49], and NYU Depth v2 [41], and outperforms existing methods by a large margin.","Huan Fu, Mingming Gong, Chaohui Wang, K.

regression,Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data,"We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros (“nonevents”). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables.

regression,Purposeful selection of variables in logistic regression,"BackgroundThe main problem in many model-building situations is to choose from a large set of covariates those that should be included in the ""best"" model. A decision to keep a variable in the model might be based on the clinical or statistical significance. There are several variable selection algorithms in existence. Those methods are mechanical and as such carry some limitations. Hosmer and Lemeshow describe a purposeful selection of covariates within which an analyst makes a variable selection decision at each step of the modeling process.MethodsIn this paper we introduce an algorithm which automates that process. We conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of this algorithm with three well documented variable selection procedures in SAS PROC LOGISTIC: FORWARD, BACKWARD, and STEPWISE.ResultsWe show that the advantage of this approach is when the analyst is interested in risk factor modeling and not just prediction. In addition to significant covariates, this variable selection procedure has the capability of retaining important confounding variables, resulting potentially in a slightly richer model. Application of the macro is further illustrated with the Hosmer and Lemeshow Worchester Heart Attack Study (WHAS) data.ConclusionIf an analyst is in need of an algorithm that will help guide the retention of significant covariates as well as confounding ones they should consider this macro as an alternative tool.","Z.

regression,Polygenic prediction via Bayesian regression and continuous shrinkage priors,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting human complex traits and diseases. Here, we present PRS-CS, a polygenic prediction method that infers posterior effect sizes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using genome-wide association summary statistics and an external linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel. PRS-CS utilizes a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework, and is distinct from previous work by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes, which is robust to varying genetic architectures, provides substantial computational advantages, and enables multivariate modeling of local LD patterns. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large. We apply PRS-CS to predict six common complex diseases and six quantitative traits in the Partners HealthCare Biobank, and further demonstrate the improvement of PRS-CS in prediction accuracy over alternative methods. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have the potential to predict complex diseases and traits from genetic data.

In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.","J.

regression,Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression,"Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing with imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different classes. However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries between classes do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as learning from such imbalanced data with continuous targets, dealing with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalizing to the entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic difference between categorical and continuous label space, we propose distribution smoothing for both labels and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects of nearby targets, and calibrates both label and learned feature distributions. We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets from common real-world tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains. Extensive experiments verify the superior performance of our strategies. Our work fills the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical imbalanced regression problems.

regression,Age Progression/Regression by Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder,"If I provide you a face image of mine (without telling you the actual age when I took the picture) and a large amount of face images that I crawled (containing labeled faces of different ages but not necessarily paired), can you show me what I would look like when I am 80 or what I was like when I was 5? The answer is probably a No. Most existing face aging works attempt to learn the transformation between age groups and thus would require the paired samples as well as the labeled query image. In this paper, we look at the problem from a generative modeling perspective such that no paired samples is required. In addition, given an unlabeled image, the generative model can directly produce the image with desired age attribute. We propose a conditional adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) that learns a face manifold, traversing on which smooth age progression and regression can be realized simultaneously. In CAAE, the face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder, and then the vector is projected to the face manifold conditional on age through a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized face features (i.e., personality) and the age condition controls progression vs. regression. Two adversarial networks are imposed on the encoder and generator, respectively, forcing to generate more photo-realistic faces. Experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance and flexibility of the proposed framework by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth.","Zhifei Zhang, Yang Song, H.

svm,Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on WGWOA-VMD-SVM,"A rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on whale gray wolf optimization algorithm-variational mode decomposition-support vector machine (WGWOA-VMD-SVM) was proposed to solve the unclear fault characterization of rolling bearing vibration signal due to its nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics. A whale gray wolf optimization algorithm (WGWOA) was proposed by combining whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and gray wolf optimization (GWO), and the rolling bearing signal was decomposed by using variational mode decomposition (VMD). Each eigenvalue was extracted as eigenvector after VMD, and the training and test sets of the fault diagnosis model were divided accordingly. The support vector machine (SVM) was used as the fault diagnosis model and optimized by using WGWOA. The validity of this method was verified by two cases of Case Western Reserve University bearing data set and laboratory test. The test results show that in the bearing data set of Case Western Reserve University, compared with the existing VMD-SVM method, the fault diagnosis accuracy rate of the WGWOA-VMD-SVM method in five repeated tests reaches 100.00%, which preliminarily verifies the feasibility of this algorithm. In the laboratory test case, the diagnostic effect of the proposed fault diagnosis method is compared with backpropagation neural network, SVM, VMD-SVM, WOA-VMD-SVM, GWO-VMD-SVM, and WGWOA-VMD-SVM. Test results show that the accuracy rate of WGWOA-VMD-SVM fault diagnosis is the highest, the accuracy rate of a single test reaches 100.00%, and the accuracy rate of five repeated tests reaches 99.75%, which is the highest compared with the above six methods. WGWOA plays a good optimization role in optimizing VMD and SVM. The signal decomposed by VMD is optimized by using the WGWOA algorithm without mode overlap. WGWOA has the better convergence performance than WOA and GWO, which further verifies its superiority among the compared methods.

svm,SVM-RFE: selection and visualization of the most relevant features through non-linear kernels,"Support vector machines (SVM) are a powerful tool to analyze data with a number of predictors approximately equal or larger than the number of observations. However, originally, application of SVM to analyze biomedical data was limited because SVM was not designed to evaluate importance of predictor variables. Creating predictor models based on only the most relevant variables is essential in biomedical research. Currently, substantial work has been done to allow assessment of variable importance in SVM models but this work has focused on SVM implemented with linear kernels. The power of SVM as a prediction model is associated with the flexibility generated by use of non-linear kernels. Moreover, SVM has been extended to model survival outcomes. This paper extends the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm by proposing three approaches to rank variables based on non-linear SVM and SVM for survival analysis. The proposed algorithms allows visualization of each one the RFE iterations, and hence, identification of the most relevant predictors of the response variable. Using simulation studies based on time-to-event outcomes and three real datasets, we evaluate the three methods, based on pseudo-samples and kernel principal component analysis, and compare them with the original SVM-RFE algorithm for non-linear kernels. The three algorithms we proposed performed generally better than the gold standard RFE for non-linear kernels, when comparing the truly most relevant variables with the variable ranks produced by each algorithm in simulation studies. Generally, the RFE-pseudo-samples outperformed the other three methods, even when variables were assumed to be correlated in all tested scenarios. The proposed approaches can be implemented with accuracy to select variables and assess direction and strength of associations in analysis of biomedical data using SVM for categorical or time-to-event responses. Conducting variable selection and interpreting direction and strength of associations between predictors and outcomes with the proposed approaches, particularly with the RFE-pseudo-samples approach can be implemented with accuracy when analyzing biomedical data. These approaches, perform better than the classical RFE of Guyon for realistic scenarios about the structure of biomedical data.","H. Sanz, C. Valim, E. Vegas, J. M. Oller, F.

The system model is utilized to generate the residual signal as the training data and the data-based algorithm of the SVM classification is employed to diagnose the fault. Due to the phenomena of data unbalance induced poor performance of the data-driven method, an undersampling procedure with the approach of linear discriminant analysis and a threshold adjustment using the algorithm of grey wolf optimizer are proposed to modify and improve the performance of classification and fault diagnosis.

svm,"Assessment of the effects of training data selection on the landslide susceptibility mapping: a comparison between support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN)","ABSTRACT Landslide is a natural hazard that results in many economic damages and human losses every year. Numerous researchers have studied landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), each attempting to improve the accuracy of the final outputs. However, few studies have been published on the training data selection effects on the LSM. Thus, this study assesses the training landslides random selection effects on support vector machine (SVM) accuracy, logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models for LSM in a catchment at the Dodangeh watershed, Mazandaran province, Iran. A 160 landslide locations inventory was collected by Geological Survey of Iran for this investigation. Different methods were implemented to define the landslide locations, such as inventory reports, satellite images and field survey. Moreover, 14 landslide conditioning factors were considered in the analysis of landslide susceptibility. These factors include curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, distance to faults, distance to stream, topographic wetness index, stream power index, terrain roughness index, sediment transport index, lithology and land use. The results show that the random landslide training data selection affected the parameter estimations of the SVM, LR and ANN algorithms. The results also show that the training samples selection had an effect on the accuracy of the susceptibility model because landslide conditioning factors vary according to the geographic locations in the study area. The LR model was found to be less sensitive than the SVM and ANN models to the training samples selection. Validation results showed that SVM and LR models outperformed the ANN model for all scenarios. The average overall accuracy of LR, SVM and ANN models are 81.42%, 79.82% and 70.2%, respectively.","B.

svm,Multiview Learning With Robust Double-Sided Twin SVM,"Multiview learning (MVL), which enhances the learners’ performance by coordinating complementarity and consistency among different views, has attracted much attention. The multiview generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (MvGSVM) is a recently proposed effective binary classification method, which introduces the concept of MVL into the classical generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM). However, this approach cannot guarantee good classification performance and robustness yet. In this article, we develop multiview robust double-sided twin SVM (MvRDTSVM) with SVM-type problems, which introduces a set of double-sided constraints into the proposed model to promote classification performance. To improve the robustness of MvRDTSVM against outliers, we take L1-norm as the distance metric. Also, a fast version of MvRDTSVM (called MvFRDTSVM) is further presented. The reformulated problems are complex, and solving them are very challenging. As one of the main contributions of this article, we design two effective iterative algorithms to optimize the proposed nonconvex problems and then conduct theoretical analysis on the algorithms. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.","Qiaolin Ye, Peng Huang, Zhao Zhang, Yuhui Zheng, L.

svm,Deep Learning Approach Combining Sparse Autoencoder With SVM for Network Intrusion Detection,"Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) provide a better solution to network security than other traditional network defense technologies, such as firewall systems. The success of NIDS is highly dependent on the performance of the algorithms and improvement methods used to increase the classification accuracy and decrease the training and testing times of the algorithms. We propose an effective deep learning approach, self-taught learning (STL)-IDS, based on the STL framework. The proposed approach is used for feature learning and dimensionality reduction. It reduces training and testing time considerably and effectively improves the prediction accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) with regard to attacks. The proposed model is built using the sparse autoencoder mechanism, which is an effective learning algorithm for reconstructing a new feature representation in an unsupervised manner. After the pre-training stage, the new features are fed into the SVM algorithm to improve its detection capability for intrusion and classification accuracy. Moreover, the efficiency of the approach in binary and multiclass classification is studied and compared with that of shallow classification methods, such as J48, naive Bayesian, random forest, and SVM. Results show that our approach has accelerated SVM training and testing times and performed better than most of the previous approaches in terms of performance metrics in binary and multiclass classification.

svm,A Novel Deep Learning Method for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Based on Improved CNN-SVM and Multichannel Data Fusion,"Intelligent fault diagnosis methods based on deep learning becomes a research hotspot in the fault diagnosis field. Automatically and accurately identifying the incipient micro-fault of rotating machinery, especially for fault orientations and severity degree, is still a major challenge in the field of intelligent fault diagnosis. The traditional fault diagnosis methods rely on the manual feature extraction of engineers with prior knowledge. To effectively identify an incipient fault in rotating machinery, this paper proposes a novel method, namely improved the convolutional neural network-support vector machine (CNN-SVM) method. This method improves the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) model structure by introducing the global average pooling technology and SVM. Firstly, the temporal and spatial multichannel raw data from multiple sensors is directly input into the improved CNN-Softmax model for the training of the CNN model. Secondly, the improved CNN are used for extracting representative features from the raw fault data. Finally, the extracted sparse representative feature vectors are input into SVM for fault classification. The proposed method is applied to the diagnosis multichannel vibration signal monitoring data of a rolling bearing. The results confirm that the proposed method is more effective than other existing intelligence diagnosis methods including SVM, K-nearest neighbor, back-propagation neural network, deep BP neural network, and traditional CNN.","Wenfeng Gong, Hui Chen, Zehui Zhang, Meiling Zhang, Ruihan Wang, C.

svm,An Evolutionary SVM Model for DDOS Attack Detection in Software Defined Networks,"Software-Defined Network (SDN) has become a promising network architecture in current days that provide network operators more control over the network infrastructure. The controller, also called as the operating system of the SDN, is responsible for running various network applications and maintaining several network services and functionalities. Despite all its capabilities, the introduction of various architectural entities of SDN poses many security threats and potential targets. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to the Internet. As the control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attacks, the goal of this paper is to detect the attack traffic, by taking the centralized control aspect of SDN. Nowadays, in the field of SDN, various machine learning (ML) techniques are being deployed for detecting malicious traffic. Despite these works, choosing the relevant features and accurate classifiers for attack detection is an open question. For better detection accuracy, in this work, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is assisted by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) with genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed SVM model, KPCA is used for reducing the dimension of feature vectors, and GA is used for optimizing different SVM parameters. In order to reduce the noise caused by feature differences, an improved kernel function (N-RBF) is proposed. The experimental results show that compared to single-SVM, the proposed model achieves more accurate classification with better generalization. Moreover, the proposed model can be embedded within the controller to define security rules to prevent possible attacks by the attackers.","K. Sahoo, B. K. Tripathy, K. Naik, S. Ramasubbareddy, B.

There were three main parameters that control the performance of the SVM model however only the type of kernel function was investigated, they were linear, radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernel functions. The results of the model were then analysed by using sum squares error (SSE), mean of sum squares error (MSSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2). It was found that the best kernel function for the SVM model was polynomial kernel function with R 2 of 0.8796. Furthermore, the LS-SVM model that trained with correct predictors had higher accuracy with R 2 of 0.9227 as compared with SVM model that trained with all the predictors with R 2 of 0.9184.

svm,Image Classification using SVM and CNN,"On the surface, teaching a computer to do something like image classification seemed very intriguing to us. Moreover, there are countless real-world applications of this concept. It is in light of these reasons that we decided to work on Image Classification. Thankfully though, this topic has been well-researched by the scientific community and we didn’t break a sweat finding resources to learn from. So naturally, we perused a bunch of research papers that dealt with image classification, each from a different perspective. We then decided to implement image classification on a small-scale with the limited hardware we were in possession of. As difficult as it was, we started with SVM and a very small dataset to achieve an accuracy of 93%. Although SVM is a very strong technique, achieving such a high accuracy is still an anomaly. We realized that our results boasted such a high accuracy due to the lack of a large enough dataset. So, using data augmentation, we more than tripled the size of our dataset. On performing SVM now, we achieved an accuracy of 82%, a significant decrease. Unsatisfied with the results, we decided to move to other deep learning techniques. This quest led us to Neural Networks and, CNN. On successfully implementing CNN, we achieved an accuracy of a staggering 93.57% on the very same dataset.

svm,Examining Hybrid and Single SVM Models with Different Kernels to Predict Rock Brittleness,"The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to assess the performance accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) models with different kernels to predict rock brittleness and (2) compare the inputs’ importance in different SVM models. To this end, the authors developed eight SVM models with different kernel types, i.e., the radial basis function (RBF), the linear (LIN), the sigmoid (SIG), and the polynomial (POL). Four of these models were developed using only the SVM method, while the four other models were hybridized with a feature selection (FS) technique. The performance of each model was assessed using five performance indices and a simple ranking system. The results of this study show that the SVM models developed using the RBF kernel achieved the highest ranking values among single and hybrid models. Concerning the importance of variables for predicting the brittleness index (BI), the Schmidt hammer rebound number (Rn) was identified as the most important variable by the three single-based models, developed by POL, SIG, and LIN kernels. However, the single SVM model developed by RBF identified density as the most important input variable. Concerning the hybrid SVM models, three models that were developed using the RBF, POL, and SIG kernels identified the point load strength index as the most important input, while the model developed using the LIN identified the Rn as the most important input. All four single-based SVM models identified the p-wave velocity (Vp) as the least important input.

svm,An Improved Intrusion Detection Algorithm Based on GA and SVM,"In the era of big data, with the increasing number of audit data features, human-centered smart intrusion detection system performance is decreasing in training time and classification accuracy, and many support vector machine (SVM)-based intrusion detection algorithms have been widely used to identify an intrusion quickly and accurately. This paper proposes the FWP-SVM-genetic algorithm (GA) (feature selection, weight, and parameter optimization of support vector machine based on the genetic algorithm) based on the characteristics of the GA and the SVM algorithm. The algorithm first optimizes the crossover probability and mutation probability of GA according to the population evolution algebra and fitness value; then, it subsequently uses a feature selection method based on the genetic algorithm with an innovation in the fitness function that decreases the SVM error rate and increases the true positive rate. Finally, according to the optimal feature subset, the feature weights and parameters of SVM are simultaneously optimized. The simulation results show that the algorithm accelerates the algorithm convergence, increases the true positive rate, decreases the error rate, and shortens the classification time. Compared with other SVM-based intrusion detection algorithms, the detection rate is higher and the false positive and false negative rates are lower.","Peiying Tao, Zhe Sun, Zhixin Sun",2018.0,207,IEEE Access,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0905a0f852377178ba94e610021b353f4ac2e875,0.9520000000000017,0.0016821062896148222,svm an improved intrusion detection algorithm based on ga and svm in the era of big data with the increasing number of audit data features humancentered smart intrusion detection system performance is decreasing in training time and classification accuracy and many support vector machine svmbased intrusion detection algorithms have been widely used to identify an intrusion quickly and accurately this paper proposes the fwpsvmgenetic algorithm ga feature selection weight and parameter optimization of support vector machine based on the genetic algorithm based on the characteristics of the ga and the svm algorithm the algorithm first optimizes the crossover probability and mutation probability of ga according to the population evolution algebra and fitness value then it subsequently uses a feature selection method based on the genetic algorithm with an innovation in the fitness function that decreases the svm error rate and increases the true positive rate finally according to the optimal feature subset the feature weights and parameters of svm are simultaneously optimized the simulation results show that the algorithm accelerates the algorithm convergence increases the true positive rate decreases the error rate and shortens the classification time compared with other svmbased intrusion detection algorithms the detection rate is higher and the false positive and false negative rates are lower peiying tao zhe sun zhixin sun

svm,Ensemble SVM Method for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification,"Sleep scoring is used as a diagnostic technique in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Automated sleep scoring is crucial, since the large volume of data should be analyzed visually by the sleep specialists which is burdensome, time-consuming tedious, subjective, and error prone. Therefore, automated sleep stage classification is a crucial step in sleep research and sleep disorder diagnosis. In this paper, a robust system, consisting of three modules, is proposed for automated classification of sleep stages from the single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). In the first module, signals taken from Pz-Oz electrode were denoised using multiscale principal component analysis. In the second module, the most informative features are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then, statistical values of DWT subbands are calculated. In the third module, extracted features were fed into an ensemble classifier, which can be called as rotational support vector machine (RotSVM). The proposed classifier combines advantages of the principal component analysis and SVM to improve classification performances of the traditional SVM. The sensitivity and accuracy values across all subjects were 84.46% and 91.1%, respectively, for the five-stage sleep classification with Cohen’s kappa coefficient of 0.88. Obtained classification performance results indicate that, it is possible to have an efficient sleep monitoring system with a single-channel EEG, and can be used effectively in medical and home-care applications.","E.

svm,Decision tree SVM model with Fisher feature selection for speech emotion recognition,"The overall recognition rate will reduce due to the increase of emotional confusion in multiple speech emotion recognition. To solve the problem, we propose a speech emotion recognition method based on the decision tree support vector machine (SVM) model with Fisher feature selection. At the stage of feature selection, Fisher criterion is used to filter out the feature parameters of higher distinguish ability. At the emotion classification stage, an algorithm is proposed to determine the structure of decision tree. The decision tree SVM can realize the two-step classification of the first rough classification and the fine classification. Thus the redundant parameters are eliminated and the performance of emotion recognition is improved. In this method, the decision tree SVM framework is firstly established by calculating the confusion degree of emotion, and then the features with higher distinguish ability are selected for each SVM of the decision tree according to Fisher criterion. Finally, speech emotion recognition is realized based on this model. The decision tree SVM with Fisher feature selection on CASIA Chinese emotion speech corpus and Berlin speech corpus are constructed to validate the effectiveness of our framework. The experimental results show that the average emotion recognition rate based on the proposed method is 9% higher than traditional SVM classification method on CASIA, and 8.26% higher on Berlin speech corpus.

svm,PVP-SVM: Sequence-Based Prediction of Phage Virion Proteins Using a Support Vector Machine,"Accurately identifying bacteriophage virion proteins from uncharacterized sequences is important to understand interactions between the phage and its host bacteria in order to develop new antibacterial drugs. However, identification of such proteins using experimental techniques is expensive and often time consuming; hence, development of an efficient computational algorithm for the prediction of phage virion proteins (PVPs) prior to in vitro experimentation is needed. Here, we describe a support vector machine (SVM)-based PVP predictor, called PVP-SVM, which was trained with 136 optimal features. A feature selection protocol was employed to identify the optimal features from a large set that included amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, atomic composition, physicochemical properties, and chain-transition-distribution. PVP-SVM achieved an accuracy of 0.870 during leave-one-out cross-validation, which was 6% higher than control SVM predictors trained with all features, indicating the efficiency of the feature selection method. Furthermore, PVP-SVM displayed superior performance compared to the currently available method, PVPred, and two other machine-learning methods developed in this study when objectively evaluated with an independent dataset.

svm,SVM and SVM Ensembles in Breast Cancer Prediction,"Breast cancer is an all too common disease in women, making how to effectively predict it an active research problem. A number of statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop various breast cancer prediction models. Among them, support vector machines (SVM) have been shown to outperform many related techniques. To construct the SVM classifier, it is first necessary to decide the kernel function, and different kernel functions can result in different prediction performance. However, there have been very few studies focused on examining the prediction performances of SVM based on different kernel functions. Moreover, it is unknown whether SVM classifier ensembles which have been proposed to improve the performance of single classifiers can outperform single SVM classifiers in terms of breast cancer prediction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fully assess the prediction performance of SVM and SVM ensembles over small and large scale breast cancer datasets. The classification accuracy, ROC, F-measure, and computational times of training SVM and SVM ensembles are compared. The experimental results show that linear kernel based SVM ensembles based on the bagging method and RBF kernel based SVM ensembles with the boosting method can be the better choices for a small scale dataset, where feature selection should be performed in the data pre-processing stage. For a large scale dataset, RBF kernel based SVM ensembles based on boosting perform better than the other classifiers.","Min-Wei Huang, Chih-Wen Chen, Wei-Chao Lin, Shih-Wen Ke, Chih-Fong Tsai",2017.0,287,PLoS ONE,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/95a8189bc8c6f7f17ab9804dfd216b84d0efd43b,0.9439999999999991,0.0023321956769055746,svm svm and svm ensembles in breast cancer prediction breast cancer is an all too common disease in women making how to effectively predict it an active research problem a number of statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop various breast cancer prediction models among them support vector machines svm have been shown to outperform many related techniques to construct the svm classifier it is first necessary to decide the kernel function and different kernel functions can result in different prediction performance however there have been very few studies focused on examining the prediction performances of svm based on different kernel functions moreover it is unknown whether svm classifier ensembles which have been proposed to improve the performance of single classifiers can outperform single svm classifiers in terms of breast cancer prediction therefore the aim of this paper is to fully assess the prediction performance of svm and svm ensembles over small and large scale breast cancer datasets the classification accuracy roc fmeasure and computational times of training svm and svm ensembles are compared the experimental results show that linear kernel based svm ensembles based on the bagging method and rbf kernel based svm ensembles with the boosting method can be the better choices for a small scale dataset where feature selection should be performed in the data preprocessing stage for a large scale dataset rbf kernel based svm ensembles based on boosting perform better than the other classifiers minwei huang chihwen chen weichao lin shihwen ke chihfong tsai

svm,SVM Parameter Optimization using Grid Search and Genetic Algorithm to Improve Classification Performance,"Machine Learning algorithms have been widely used to solve various kinds of data classification problems. Classification problem especially for high dimensional datasets have attracted many researchers in order to find efficient approaches to address them. However, the classification problem has become very complicated and computationally expensive, especially when the number of possible different combinations of variables is so high. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been proven to perform much better when dealing with high dimensional datasets and numerical features. Although SVM works well with default value, the performance of SVM can be improved significantly using parameter optimization. We applied two methods which are Grid Search and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the SVM parameters. Our experiment showed that SVM parameter optimization using grid search always finds near optimal parameter combination within the given ranges. However, grid search was very slow; therefore it was very reliable only in low dimensional datasets with few parameters. SVM parameter optimization using GA can be used to solve the problem of grid search. GA has proven to be more stable than grid search. Based on average running time on 9 datasets, GA was almost 16 times faster than grid search.

svm,Convolutional SVM Networks for Object Detection in UAV Imagery,"Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are viewed as effective acquisition platforms for several civilian applications. They can acquire images with an extremely high level of spatial detail compared to standard remote sensing platforms. However, these images are highly affected by illumination, rotation, and scale changes, which further increases the complexity of analysis compared to those obtained using standard remote sensing platforms. In this paper, we introduce a novel convolutional support vector machine (CSVM) network for the analysis of this type of imagery. Basically, the CSVM network is based on several alternating convolutional and reduction layers ended by a linear SVM classification layer. The convolutional layers in CSVM rely on a set of linear SVMs as filter banks for feature map generation. During the learning phase, the weights of the SVM filters are computed through a forward supervised learning strategy unlike the backpropagation algorithm widely used in standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This makes the proposed CSVM particularly suitable for detecting problems characterized by very limited training sample availability. The experiments carried out on two UAV data sets related to vehicles and solar-panel detection issues, with a 2-cm resolution, confirm the promising capability of the proposed CSVM network compared to recent state-of-the-art solutions based on pretrained CNNs.","Y.

svm,Real-time transient stability assessment in power system based on improved SVM,"Due to the strict requirements of extremely high accuracy and fast computational speed, real-time transient stability assessment (TSA) has always been a tough problem in power system analysis. Fortunately, the development of artificial intelligence and big data technologies provide the new prospective methods to this issue, and there have been some successful trials on using intelligent method, such as support vector machine (SVM) method. However, the traditional SVM method cannot avoid false classification, and the interpretability of the results needs to be strengthened and clear. This paper proposes a new strategy to solve the shortcomings of traditional SVM, which can improve the interpretability of results, and avoid the problem of false alarms and missed alarms. In this strategy, two improved SVMs, which are called aggressive support vector machine (ASVM) and conservative support vector machine (CSVM), are proposed to improve the accuracy of the classification. And two improved SVMs can ensure the stability or instability of the power system in most cases. For the small amount of cases with undetermined stability, a new concept of grey region (GR) is built to measure the uncertainty of the results, and GR can assessment the instable probability of the power system.

svm,Comparative Study on KNN and SVM Based Weather Classification Models for Day Ahead Short Term Solar PV Power Forecasting,"Accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is an essential tool for mitigating the negative effects caused by the uncertainty of PV output power in systems with high penetration levels of solar PV generation. Weather classification based modeling is an effective way to increase the accuracy of day-ahead short-term (DAST) solar PV power forecasting because PV output power is strongly dependent on the specific weather conditions in a given time period. However, the accuracy of daily weather classification relies on both the applied classifiers and the training data. This paper aims to reveal how these two factors impact the classification performance and to delineate the relation between classification accuracy and sample dataset scale. Two commonly used classification methods, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM) are applied to classify the daily local weather types for DAST solar PV power forecasting using the operation data from a grid-connected PV plant in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. We assessed the performance of SVM and KNN approaches, and then investigated the influences of sample scale, the number of categories, and the data distribution in different categories on the daily weather classification results. The simulation results illustrate that SVM performs well with small sample scale, while KNN is more sensitive to the length of the training dataset and can achieve higher accuracy than SVM with sufficient samples.","Fei Wang, Z.

svm,"Deep Learning, Sparse Coding, and SVM for Melanoma Recognition in Dermoscopy Images","This work presents an approach for melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images that combines deep learning, sparse coding, and support vector machine SVM learning algorithms. One of the beneficial aspects of the proposed approach is that unsupervised learning within the domain, and feature transfer from the domain of natural photographs, eliminates the need of annotated data in the target task to learn good features. The applied feature transfer also allows the system to draw analogies between observations in dermoscopic images and observations in the natural world, mimicking the process clinical experts themselves employ to describe patterns in skin lesions. To evaluate the methodology, performance is measured on a dataset obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, containing 2624 clinical cases of melanoma 334, atypical nevi 144, and benign lesions 2146. The approach is compared to the prior state-of-art method on this dataset. Two-fold cross-validation is performed 20 times for evaluation 40 total experiments, and two discrimination tasks are examined: 1 melanoma vs. all non-melanoma lesions, and 2 melanoma vs. atypical lesions only. The presented approach achieves an accuracy of 93.1% 94.9% sensitivity, and 92.8% specificity for the first task, and 73.9% accuracy 73.8% sensitivity, and 74.3% specificity for the second task. In comparison, prior state-of-art ensemble modeling approaches alone yield 91.2% accuracy 93.0% sensitivity, and 91.0% specificity first the first task, and 71.5% accuracy 72.7% sensitivity, and 68.9% specificity for the second. Differences in performance were statistically significant p $$<$$ 0.05, suggesting the proposed approach is an effective improvement over prior state-of-art.","N.

svm,Selecting Feature Subsets Based on SVM-RFE and the Overlapping Ratio with Applications in Bioinformatics,"Feature selection is an important topic in bioinformatics. Defining informative features from complex high dimensional biological data is critical in disease study, drug development, etc. Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is an efficient feature selection technique that has shown its power in many applications. It ranks the features according to the recursive feature deletion sequence based on SVM. In this study, we propose a method, SVM-RFE-OA, which combines the classification accuracy rate and the average overlapping ratio of the samples to determine the number of features to be selected from the feature rank of SVM-RFE. Meanwhile, to measure the feature weights more accurately, we propose a modified SVM-RFE-OA (M-SVM-RFE-OA) algorithm that temporally screens out the samples lying in a heavy overlapping area in each iteration. The experiments on the eight public biological datasets show that the discriminative ability of the feature subset could be measured more accurately by combining the classification accuracy rate with the average overlapping degree of the samples compared with using the classification accuracy rate alone, and shielding the samples in the overlapping area made the calculation of the feature weights more stable and accurate. The methods proposed in this study can also be used with other RFE techniques to define potential biomarkers from big biological data.","Xiaohui Lin, C.

svm,Comparative Analysis of ANN and SVM Models Combined with Wavelet Preprocess for Groundwater Depth Prediction,"Reliable prediction of groundwater depth fluctuations has been an important component in sustainable water resources management. In this study, a data-driven prediction model combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocess and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed for groundwater depth forecasting. Regular artificial neural networks (ANN), regular SVM, and wavelet preprocessed artificial neural networks (WANN) models were also developed for comparison. These methods were applied to the monthly groundwater depth records over a period of 37 years from ten wells in the Mengcheng County, China. Relative absolute error (RAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were adopted for model evaluation. The results indicate that wavelet preprocess extremely improved the training and test performance of ANN and SVM models. The WSVM model provided the most precise and reliable groundwater depth prediction compared with ANN, SVM, and WSVM models. The criterion of RAE, r, RMSE, and NSE values for proposed WSVM model are 0.20, 0.97, 0.18 and 0.94, respectively. Comprehensive comparisons and discussion revealed that wavelet preprocess extremely improves the prediction precision and reliability for both SVM and ANN models. The prediction result of SVM model is superior to ANN model in generalization ability and precision. Nevertheless, the performance of WANN is superior to SVM model, which further validates the power of data preprocess in data-driven prediction models. Finally, the optimal model, WSVM, is discussed by comparing its subseries performances as well as model performance stability, revealing the efficiency and universality of WSVM model in data driven prediction field.","Tinggang Zhou, Faxin Wang, Z.

svm,A Prediction of Precipitation Data Based on Support Vector Machine and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-SVM) Algorithms,"Precipitation is a very important topic in weather forecasts. Weather forecasts, especially precipitation prediction, poses complex tasks because they depend on various parameters to predict the dependent variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, which are changing from time to time and weather calculation varies with the geographical location along with its atmospheric variables. To improve the prediction accuracy of precipitation, this context proposes a prediction model for rainfall forecast based on Support Vector Machine with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-SVM) to replace the linear threshold used in traditional precipitation. Parameter selection has a critical impact on the predictive accuracy of SVM, and PSO is proposed to find the optimal parameters for SVM. The PSO-SVM algorithm was used for the training of a model by using the historical data for precipitation prediction, which can be useful information and used by people of all walks of life in making wise and intelligent decisions. The simulations demonstrate that prediction models indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm has much better accuracy than the direct prediction model based on a set of experimental data if other things are equal. On the other hand, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the SVM-PSO model used in machine learning and further promises the scope for improvement as more and more relevant attributes can be used in predicting the dependent variables.","J.

svm,An SVM-Based Solution for Fault Detection in Wind Turbines,"Research into fault diagnosis in machines with a wide range of variable loads and speeds, such as wind turbines, is of great industrial interest. Analysis of the power signals emitted by wind turbines for the diagnosis of mechanical faults in their mechanical transmission chain is insufficient. A successful diagnosis requires the inclusion of accelerometers to evaluate vibrations. This work presents a multi-sensory system for fault diagnosis in wind turbines, combined with a data-mining solution for the classification of the operational state of the turbine. The selected sensors are accelerometers, in which vibration signals are processed using angular resampling techniques and electrical, torque and speed measurements. Support vector machines (SVMs) are selected for the classification task, including two traditional and two promising new kernels. This multi-sensory system has been validated on a test-bed that simulates the real conditions of wind turbines with two fault typologies: misalignment and imbalance. Comparison of SVM performance with the results of artificial neural networks (ANNs) shows that linear kernel SVM outperforms other kernels and ANNs in terms of accuracy, training and tuning times.

When classes are difficult to discriminate, it makes sense to allow k guesses and evaluate classifiers based on the top-k error instead of the standard zero-one loss.

As various information and data about lncRNAs are preserved by previous studies, it is appealing to develop novel methods to identify the lncRNAs more accurately. Our method lncRScan-SVM aims at classifying PCTs and LNCTs using support vector machine (SVM). The gold-standard datasets for lncRScan-SVM model training, lncRNA prediction and method comparison were constructed according to the GENCODE gene annotations of human and mouse respectively. By integrating features derived from gene structure, transcript sequence, potential codon sequence and conservation, lncRScan-SVM outperforms other approaches, which is evaluated by several criteria such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under curve (AUC). In addition, several known human lncRNA datasets were assessed using lncRScan-SVM.

This study combines feature selection and SVM recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to investigate the classification accuracy of multiclass problems for Dermatology and Zoo databases. Dermatology dataset contains 33 feature variables, 1 class variable, and 366 testing instances; and the Zoo dataset contains 16 feature variables, 1 class variable, and 101 testing instances. The feature variables in the two datasets were sorted in descending order by explanatory power, and different feature sets were selected by SVM-RFE to explore classification accuracy. Meanwhile, Taguchi method was jointly combined with SVM classifier in order to optimize parameters C and γ to increase classification accuracy for multiclass classification.

svm,F-SVM: Combination of Feature Transformation and SVM Learning via Convex Relaxation,"The generalization error bound of support vector machine (SVM) depends on the ratio of radius and margin, while standard SVM only considers the maximization of the margin but ignores the minimization of the radius. Several approaches have been proposed to integrate radius and margin for joint learning of feature transformation and SVM classifier. However, most of them either require the form of the transformation matrix to be diagonal, or are non-convex and computationally expensive. In this paper, we suggest a novel approximation for the radius of minimum enclosing ball (MEB) in feature space, and then propose a convex radius-margin based SVM model for joint learning of feature transformation and SVM classifier, i.e., F-SVM. An alternating minimization method is adopted to solve the F-SVM model, where the feature transformation is updatedvia gradient descent and the classifier is updated by employing the existing SVM solver. By incorporating with kernel principal component analysis, F-SVM is further extended for joint learning of nonlinear transformation and classifier. Experimental results on the UCI machine learning datasets and the LFW face datasets show that F-SVM outperforms the standard SVM and the existing radius-margin based SVMs, e.g., RMM, R-SVM+ and R-SVM+{\mu}.","Xiaohe Wu, W.

svm,Feature Selection for Classification of Hyperspectral Data by SVM,"Support vector machines (SVM) are attractive for the classification of remotely sensed data with some claims that the method is insensitive to the dimensionality of the data and, therefore, does not require a dimensionality-reduction analysis in preprocessing. Here, a series of classification analyses with two hyperspectral sensor data sets reveals that the accuracy of a classification by an SVM does vary as a function of the number of features used. Critically, it is shown that the accuracy of a classification may decline significantly (at 0.05 level of statistical significance) with the addition of features, particularly if a small training sample is used. This highlights a dependence of the accuracy of classification by an SVM on the dimensionality of the data and, therefore, the potential value of undertaking a feature-selection analysis prior to classification. Additionally, it is demonstrated that, even when a large training sample is available, feature selection may still be useful. For example, the accuracy derived from the use of a small number of features may be noninferior (at 0.05 level of significance) to that derived from the use of a larger feature set providing potential advantages in relation to issues such as data storage and computational processing costs. Feature selection may, therefore, be a valuable analysis to include in preprocessing operations for classification by an SVM.","M. Pal, G.

This approach also encourages in-novation in interdisciplinary research. This technique utilizes the concept of decision trees, con-structing a collection of decision trees and aggregating their outcomes to generate the ultimate prediction. Every decision tree inside a random forest is constructed using random subsets of data, and each individual tree is trained on a portion of the whole dataset. Subsequently, the outcomes of all decision trees are amalgamated to derive the ultimate forecast. One of the bene-fits of random forests is their capacity to handle unbalanced data and variables with missing values. Additionally, it mitigates the issue of arbitrary variable selection seen by certain alterna-tive models. Furthermore, random forests mitigate the issue of overfitting by training several de-cision trees on random subsets of data, hence enhancing their ability to generalize to novel data. Random forests are highly regarded as one of the most efficient and potent techniques in the domain of machine learning. They find extensive use in various applications such as automatic categorization, data forecasting, and supervisory learning.","Hasan Ahmed Salman, Ali Kalakech, Amani Steiti",2024.0,133,Babylonian Journal of Machine Learning,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49fc5936ce2f5b2ab89f3e8fd6b397ae9b8b5250,1.0,0.001080773606370876,random forest random forest algorithm overview a random forest is a machine learning model utilized in classification and forecasting to train machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence models it is crucial to have a substantial amount of highquality data for effective data collecting system performance data is essential for refining algorithms enhancing the efficiency of software and hardware evaluating user behavior enabling pattern identification decisionmaking predictive modeling and problemsolving ultimately resulting in improved effectiveness and accuracy the integration of diverse data collecting and processing methods enhances precision and innovation in problemsolving utilizing diverse methodologies in interdisciplinary research streamlines the research process fosters innovation and enables the application of data analysis findings to pattern recognition decisionmaking predictive modeling and problemsolving this approach also encourages innovation in interdisciplinary research this technique utilizes the concept of decision trees constructing a collection of decision trees and aggregating their outcomes to generate the ultimate prediction every decision tree inside a random forest is constructed using random subsets of data and each individual tree is trained on a portion of the whole dataset subsequently the outcomes of all decision trees are amalgamated to derive the ultimate forecast one of the benefits of random forests is their capacity to handle unbalanced data and variables with missing values additionally it mitigates the issue of arbitrary variable selection seen by certain alternative models furthermore random forests mitigate the issue of overfitting by training several decision trees on random subsets of data hence enhancing their ability to generalize to novel data random forests are highly regarded as one of the most efficient and potent techniques in the domain of machine learning they find extensive use in various applications such as automatic categorization data forecasting and supervisory learning hasan ahmed salman ali kalakech amani steiti

random forest,Hyperparameters and tuning strategies for random forest,"The random forest (RF) algorithm has several hyperparameters that have to be set by the user, for example, the number of observations drawn randomly for each tree and whether they are drawn with or without replacement, the number of variables drawn randomly for each split, the splitting rule, the minimum number of samples that a node must contain, and the number of trees. In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model‐based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically.

random forest,A review on longitudinal data analysis with random forest,"Abstract In longitudinal studies variables are measured repeatedly over time, leading to clustered and correlated observations. If the goal of the study is to develop prediction models, machine learning approaches such as the powerful random forest (RF) are often promising alternatives to standard statistical methods, especially in the context of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we review extensions of the standard RF method for the purpose of longitudinal data analysis. Extension methods are categorized according to the data structures for which they are designed. We consider both univariate and multivariate response longitudinal data and further categorize the repeated measurements according to whether the time effect is relevant. Even though most extensions are proposed for low-dimensional data, some can be applied to high-dimensional data.

random forest,"Basic Tenets of Classification Algorithms K-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Neural Network: A Review","In this paper, sixty-eight research articles published between 2000 and 2017 as well as textbooks which employed four classification algorithms: K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN) as the main statistical tools were reviewed. The aim was to examine and compare these nonparametric classification methods on the following attributes: robustness to training data, sensitivity to changes, data fitting, stability, ability to handle large data sizes, sensitivity to noise, time invested in parameter tuning, and accuracy. The performances, strengths and shortcomings of each of the algorithms were examined, and finally, a conclusion was arrived at on which one has higher performance. It was evident from the literature reviewed that RF is too sensitive to small changes in the training dataset and is occasionally unstable and tends to overfit in the model. KNN is easy to implement and understand but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slow as the size of the data in use grows, while the ideal value of K for the KNN classifier is difficult to set. SVM and RF are insensitive to noise or overtraining, which shows their ability in dealing with unbalanced data. Larger input datasets will lengthen classification times for NN and KNN more than for SVM and RF. Among these nonparametric classification methods, NN has the potential to become a more widely used classification algorithm, but because of their time-consuming parameter tuning procedure, high level of complexity in computational processing, the numerous types of NN architectures to choose from and the high number of algorithms used for training, most researchers recommend SVM and RF as easier and wieldy used methods which repeatedly achieve results with high accuracies and are often faster to implement.","E.

random forest,Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving Random Forest Proximities,"Random forests are considered one of the best out-of-the-box classification and regression algorithms due to their high level of predictive performance with relatively little tuning. Pairwise proximities can be computed from a trained random forest and measure the similarity between data points relative to the supervised task. Random forest proximities have been used in many applications including the identification of variable importance, data imputation, outlier detection, and data visualization. However, existing definitions of random forest proximities do not accurately reflect the data geometry learned by the random forest. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest-Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving proximities (RF-GAP). We prove that the proximity-weighted sum (regression) or majority vote (classification) using RF-GAP exactly matches the out-of-bag random forest prediction, thus capturing the data geometry learned by the random forest. We empirically show that this improved geometric representation outperforms traditional random forest proximities in tasks such as data imputation and provides outlier detection and visualization results consistent with the learned data geometry.","Jake S.

random forest,Random forest as a generic framework for predictive modeling of spatial and spatio-temporal variables,"Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as “knowledge engines” in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality—especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.","T.

random forest,Extending approximate Bayesian computation with supervised machine learning to infer demographic history from genetic polymorphisms using DIYABC Random Forest,"Simulation‐based methods such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are well‐adapted to the analysis of complex scenarios of populations and species genetic history. In this context, supervised machine learning (SML) methods provide attractive statistical solutions to conduct efficient inferences about scenario choice and parameter estimation. The Random Forest methodology (RF) is a powerful ensemble of SML algorithms used for classification or regression problems. Random Forest allows conducting inferences at a low computational cost, without preliminary selection of the relevant components of the ABC summary statistics, and bypassing the derivation of ABC tolerance levels. We have implemented a set of RF algorithms to process inferences using simulated data sets generated from an extended version of the population genetic simulator implemented in DIYABC v2.1.0. The resulting computer package, named DIYABC Random Forest v1.0, integrates two functionalities into a user‐friendly interface: the simulation under custom evolutionary scenarios of different types of molecular data (microsatellites, DNA sequences or SNPs) and RF treatments including statistical tools to evaluate the power and accuracy of inferences. We illustrate the functionalities of DIYABC Random Forest v1.0 for both scenario choice and parameter estimation through the analysis of pseudo‐observed and real data sets corresponding to pool‐sequencing and individual‐sequencing SNP data sets. Because of the properties inherent to the implemented RF methods and the large feature vector (including various summary statistics and their linear combinations) available for SNP data, DIYABC Random Forest v1.0 can efficiently contribute to the analysis of large SNP data sets to make inferences about complex population genetic histories.","François-David Collin, G.

random forest,Land Cover Classification using Google Earth Engine and Random Forest Classifier - The Role of Image Composition,"Land cover information plays a vital role in many aspects of life, from scientific and economic to political. Accurate information about land cover affects the accuracy of all subsequent applications, therefore accurate and timely land cover information is in high demand. In land cover classification studies over the past decade, higher accuracies were produced when using time series satellite images than when using single date images. Recently, the availability of the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing platform, has gained the attention of remote sensing based applications where temporal aggregation methods derived from time series images are widely applied (i.e., the use the metrics such as mean or median), instead of time series images. In GEE, many studies simply select as many images as possible to fill gaps without concerning how different year/season images might affect the classification accuracy. This study aims to analyze the effect of different composition methods, as well as different input images, on the classification results. We use Landsat 8 surface reflectance (L8sr) data with eight different combination strategies to produce and evaluate land cover maps for a study area in Mongolia. We implemented the experiment on the GEE platform with a widely applied algorithm, the Random Forest (RF) classifier. Our results show that all the eight datasets produced moderately to highly accurate land cover maps, with overall accuracy over 84.31%. Among the eight datasets, two time series datasets of summer scenes (images from 1 June to 30 September) produced the highest accuracy (89.80% and 89.70%), followed by the median composite of the same input images (88.74%). The difference between these three classifications was not significant based on the McNemar test (p > 0.05). However, significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed for all other pairs involving one of these three datasets. The results indicate that temporal aggregation (e.g., median) is a promising method, which not only significantly reduces data volume (resulting in an easier and faster analysis) but also produces an equally high accuracy as time series data. The spatial consistency among the classification results was relatively low compared to the general high accuracy, showing that the selection of the dataset used in any classification on GEE is an important and crucial step, because the input images for the composition play an essential role in land cover classification, particularly with snowy, cloudy and expansive areas like Mongolia.","Phan Thanh Noi, V.

random forest,Random Forest Spatial Interpolation,"For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift and regression kriging have become basic techniques that benefit both from spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The first case study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed stationary random fields with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily precipitation data for the 2016–2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies, RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting, random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp, particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution prediction maps were made.","Aleksandar Sekulić, M. Kilibarda, G.

random forest,Improving random forest predictions in small datasets from two-phase sampling designs,"Background While random forests are one of the most successful machine learning methods, it is necessary to optimize their performance for use with datasets resulting from a two-phase sampling design with a small number of cases—a common situation in biomedical studies, which often have rare outcomes and covariates whose measurement is resource-intensive. Methods Using an immunologic marker dataset from a phase III HIV vaccine efficacy trial, we seek to optimize random forest prediction performance using combinations of variable screening, class balancing, weighting, and hyperparameter tuning. Results Our experiments show that while class balancing helps improve random forest prediction performance when variable screening is not applied, class balancing has a negative impact on performance in the presence of variable screening. The impact of the weighting similarly depends on whether variable screening is applied. Hyperparameter tuning is ineffective in situations with small sample sizes. We further show that random forests under-perform generalized linear models for some subsets of markers, and prediction performance on this dataset can be improved by stacking random forests and generalized linear models trained on different subsets of predictors, and that the extent of improvement depends critically on the dissimilarities between candidate learner predictions. Conclusion In small datasets from two-phase sampling design, variable screening and inverse sampling probability weighting are important for achieving good prediction performance of random forests.

random forest,Random forest-based prediction of stroke outcome,"We research into the clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging factors associated with the outcome of stroke patients to generate a predictive model using machine learning techniques for prediction of mortality and morbidity 3-months after admission. The dataset consisted of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) admitted to Stroke Unit of a European Tertiary Hospital prospectively registered. We identified the main variables for machine learning Random Forest (RF), generating a predictive model that can estimate patient mortality/morbidity according to the following groups: (1) IS + ICH, (2) IS, and (3) ICH. A total of 6022 patients were included: 4922 (mean age 71.9 ± 13.8 years) with IS and 1100 (mean age 73.3 ± 13.1 years) with ICH. NIHSS at 24, 48 h and axillary temperature at admission were the most important variables to consider for evolution of patients at 3-months. IS + ICH group was the most stable for mortality prediction [0.904 ± 0.025 of area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)]. IS group presented similar results, although variability between experiments was slightly higher (0.909 ± 0.032 of AUC). ICH group was the one in which RF had more problems to make adequate predictions (0.9837 vs. 0.7104 of AUC). There were no major differences between IS and IS + ICH groups according to morbidity prediction (0.738 and 0.755 of AUC) but, after checking normality with a Shapiro Wilk test with the null hypothesis that the data follow a normal distribution, it was rejected with W = 0.93546 (p-value < 2.2e−16). Conditions required for a parametric test do not hold, and we performed a paired Wilcoxon Test assuming the null hypothesis that all the groups have the same performance. The null hypothesis was rejected with a value < 2.2e−16, so there are statistical differences between IS and ICH groups.

random forest,Random forest versus logistic regression: a large-scale benchmark experiment,"The Random Forest (RF) algorithm for regression and classification has considerably gained popularity since its introduction in 2001. Meanwhile, it has grown to a standard classification approach competing with logistic regression in many innovation-friendly scientific fields. In this context, we present a large scale benchmarking experiment based on 243 real datasets comparing the prediction performance of the original version of RF with default parameters and LR as binary classification tools. Most importantly, the design of our benchmark experiment is inspired from clinical trial methodology, thus avoiding common pitfalls and major sources of biases. RF performed better than LR according to the considered accuracy measured in approximately 69% of the datasets. The mean difference between RF and LR was 0.029 (95%-CI =[0.022,0.038]) for the accuracy, 0.041 (95%-CI =[0.031,0.053]) for the Area Under the Curve, and − 0.027 (95%-CI =[−0.034,−0.021]) for the Brier score, all measures thus suggesting a significantly better performance of RF. As a side-result of our benchmarking experiment, we observed that the results were noticeably dependent on the inclusion criteria used to select the example datasets, thus emphasizing the importance of clear statements regarding this dataset selection process. We also stress that neutral studies similar to ours, based on a high number of datasets and carefully designed, will be necessary in the future to evaluate further variants, implementations or parameters of random forests which may yield improved accuracy compared to the original version with default values.","R.

random forest,"PM2.5 Prediction Based on Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data","In recent years, air pollution has become an important public health concern. The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran’s urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 µg/m3, and RMSE = 13.58 µg/m3 using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded.

Taking Wuqi County in the hinterland of the Loess Plateau as the research area, using Bayesian hyperparameters to optimize random forest and extreme gradient boosting decision trees model for landslide susceptibility mapping, and the two optimized models are compared. In addition, 14 landslide influencing factors are selected, and 734 landslides are obtained according to field investigation and reports from literals. The landslides were randomly divided into training data (70%) and validation data (30%). The hyperparameters of the random forest and extreme gradient boosting decision tree models were optimized using a Bayesian algorithm, and then the optimal hyperparameters are selected for landslide susceptibility mapping. Both models were evaluated and compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix. The results show that the AUC validation data of the Bayesian optimized random forest and extreme gradient boosting decision tree model are 0.88 and 0.86, respectively, which showed an improvement of 4 and 3%, indicating that the prediction performance of the two models has been improved. However, the random forest model has a higher predictive ability than the extreme gradient boosting decision tree model.

random forest,Multimodal Data Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Clustering Evolutionary Random Forest,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a severe medical challenge. Advances in technologies produced high-dimensional data of different modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Understanding the complex association patterns among these heterogeneous and complementary data is of benefit to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In this paper, we apply the appropriate correlation analysis method to detect the relationships between brain regions and genes, and propose “brain region-gene pairs” as the multimodal features of the sample. In addition, we put forward a novel data analysis method from technology aspect, cluster evolutionary random forest (CERF), which is suitable for “brain region-gene pairs”. The idea of clustering evolution is introduced to improve the generalization performance of random forest which is constructed by randomly selecting samples and sample features. Through hierarchical clustering of decision trees in random forest, the decision trees with higher similarity are clustered into one class, and the decision trees with the best performance are retained to enhance the diversity between decision trees. Furthermore, based on CERF, we integrate feature construction, feature selection and sample classification to find the optimal combination of different methods, and design a comprehensive diagnostic framework for AD. The framework is validated by the samples with both fMRI and SNP data from ADNI. The results show that we can effectively identify AD patients and discover some brain regions and genes associated with AD significantly based on this framework.

random forest,A New Random Forest Algorithm Based on Learning Automata,"The goal of aggregating the base classifiers is to achieve an aggregated classifier that has a higher resolution than individual classifiers. Random forest is one of the types of ensemble learning methods that have been considered more than other ensemble learning methods due to its simple structure, ease of understanding, as well as higher efficiency than similar methods. The ability and efficiency of classical methods are always influenced by the data. The capabilities of independence from the data domain, and the ability to adapt to problem space conditions, are the most challenging issues about the different types of classifiers. In this paper, a method based on learning automata is presented, through which the adaptive capabilities of the problem space, as well as the independence of the data domain, are added to the random forest to increase its efficiency. Using the idea of reinforcement learning in the random forest has made it possible to address issues with data that have a dynamic behaviour. Dynamic behaviour refers to the variability in the behaviour of a data sample in different domains. Therefore, to evaluate the proposed method, and to create an environment with dynamic behaviour, different domains of data have been considered. In the proposed method, the idea is added to the random forest using learning automata. The reason for this choice is the simple structure of the learning automata and the compatibility of the learning automata with the problem space.

random forest,Random Forest Prediction Intervals,"Abstract Random forests are among the most popular machine learning techniques for prediction problems. When using random forests to predict a quantitative response, an important but often overlooked challenge is the determination of prediction intervals that will contain an unobserved response value with a specified probability. We propose new random forest prediction intervals that are based on the empirical distribution of out-of-bag prediction errors. These intervals can be obtained as a by-product of a single random forest. Under regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed intervals have asymptotically correct coverage rates. Simulation studies and analysis of 60 real datasets are used to compare the finite-sample properties of the proposed intervals with quantile regression forests and recently proposed split conformal intervals. The results indicate that intervals constructed with our proposed method tend to be narrower than those of competing methods while still maintaining marginal coverage rates approximately equal to nominal levels.","Haozhe Zhang, Joshua Zimmerman, D.

random forest,Enriched Random Forest for High Dimensional Genomic Data,"Ensemble methods such as random forest works well on high-dimensional datasets. However, when the number of features is extremely large compared to the number of samples and the percentage of truly informative feature is very small, performance of traditional random forest decline significantly. To this end, we develop a novel approach that enhance the performance of traditional random forest by reducing the contribution of trees whose nodes are populated with less informative features. The proposed method selects eligible subsets at each node by weighted random sampling as opposed to simple random sampling in traditional random forest. We refer to this modified random forest algorithm as ”Enriched Random Forest”. Using several high-dimensional micro-array datasets, we evaluate the performance of our approach in both regression and classification settings.

random forest,Autocorrelation Aided Random Forest Classifier-Based Bearing Fault Detection Framework,"Rolling bearing defects in induction motors are usually diagnosed using vibration signal analysis. For accurate detection of rolling bearing defects, appropriate feature extraction from vibration signals is necessary, failure of which may lead to incorrect interpretation. Considering the above fact, this article presents an autocorrelation aided feature extraction method for diagnosis of rolling bearing defects. To this end, the vibration signals of healthy as well as different faulty bearings were recorded using accelerometers and autocorrelation of the respective vibration signals were done to examine their self-similarity in time scale. Following this, several statistical, hjorth as well as non-linear features were extracted from the respective vibration correlograms and were subjected to feature reduction using recursive feature elimination technique. The dimensionally reduced top ranked feature vectors were subsequently fed to a random forest classifier for classification of vibration signals. A large number of experiments were carried out for (i) three different fault diameters at (ii) four different shaft speeds and also at (iii) two different sampling frequencies. Besides, for each condition, six binary class and one multiclass classification problem is also addressed in this paper, resulting in a total 112 different classification tasks.

random forest,Enhanced Random Forest With Concurrent Analysis of Static and Dynamic Nodes for Industrial Fault Classification,"In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to industrial processes. However, the concurrent analysis of static and dynamic representations has not been comprehensively addressed for industrial process fault classification. In this paper, an enhanced random forest algorithm with a concurrent analysis of static and dynamic nodes is proposed to address this issue for fault classification. First, the standard slow feature analysis is modified by designing a new slowness index that is more suitable for a supervised fault classification problem. Second, a feature ranking process is conducted to determine the significant features. These features, which substitute the raw variables in the nodes, are used to build the enhanced random forest. Using this scheme, the significant static and dynamic nodes are selected to enhance the discriminative ability and interpretation. Additionally, the slow features that are uncorrelated are more suitable for training the forest than the initial correlated variables, and the dynamic characteristics of industrial processes are thus comprehensively addressed.

The intrusion detection system (IDS) helps to find the attacks on the system and the intruders are detected. Previously various machine learning (ML) techniques are applied on the IDS and tried to improve the results on the detection of intruders and to increase the accuracy of the IDS. This paper has proposed an approach to develop efficient IDS by using the principal component analysis (PCA) and the random forest classification algorithm. Where the PCA will help to organise the dataset by reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and the random forest will help in classification. Results obtained states that the proposed approach works more efficiently in terms of accuracy as compared to other techniques like SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.

random forest,Identifying Forest Fire Driving Factors and Related Impacts in China Using Random Forest Algorithm,"Reasonable forest fire management measures can effectively reduce the losses caused by forest fires and forest fire driving factors and their impacts are important aspects that should be considered in forest fire management. We used the random forest model and MODIS Global Fire Atlas dataset (2010~2016) to analyse the impacts of climate, topographic, vegetation and socioeconomic variables on forest fire occurrence in six geographical regions in China. The results show clear regional differences in the forest fire driving factors and their impacts in China. Climate variables are the forest fire driving factors in all regions of China, vegetation variable is the forest fire driving factor in all other regions except the Northwest region and topographic variables and socioeconomic variables are only the driving factors of forest fires in a few regions (Northwest and Southwest regions). The model predictive capability is good: the AUC values are between 0.830 and 0.975, and the prediction accuracy is between 70.0% and 91.4%. High fire hazard areas are concentrated in the Northeast region, Southwest region and East China region.

random forest,Targeting predictors in random forest regression,"The random forest regression (RF) has become an extremely popular tool to analyze high-dimensional data. Nonetheless, it has been argued that its benefits are lessened in sparse high-dimensional settings due to the presence of weak predictors and an initial dimension reduction (targeting) step prior to estimation is required. We show theoretically that, in high-dimensional settings with limited signal, proper targeting is an important complement to RF's feature sampling by controlling the probability of placing splits along strong predictors. This is supported by simulations with representable finite samples. Moreover, we quantify the immediate gain from targeting in terms of increased strength of individual trees. Our conclusions are elaborated by a broad set of applications within macroeconomics and finance. These show that the inherent bias-variance trade-off implied by targeting, due to increased tree correlation, is balanced at a medium level, selecting the best 10-30\% of commonly applied predictors. The applications consolidate that improvements from the targeted RF over the ordinary RF can be significant, particularly in long-horizon forecasting, and both in expansions and recessions.","Daniel D.

random forest,CHIRPS: Explaining random forest classification,"Modern machine learning methods typically produce “black box” models that are opaque to interpretation. Yet, their demand has been increasing in the Human-in-the-Loop processes, that is, those processes that require a human agent to verify, approve or reason about the automated decisions before they can be applied. To facilitate this interpretation, we propose Collection of High Importance Random Path Snippets (CHIRPS); a novel algorithm for explaining random forest classification per data instance. CHIRPS extracts a decision path from each tree in the forest that contributes to the majority classification, and then uses frequent pattern mining to identify the most commonly occurring split conditions. Then a simple, conjunctive form rule is constructed where the antecedent terms are derived from the attributes that had the most influence on the classification. This rule is returned alongside estimates of the rule’s precision and coverage on the training data along with counter-factual details. An experimental study involving nine data sets shows that classification rules returned by CHIRPS have a precision at least as high as the state of the art when evaluated on unseen data (0.91–0.99) and offer a much greater coverage (0.04–0.54). Furthermore, CHIRPS uniquely controls against under- and over-fitting solutions by maximising novel objective functions that are better suited to the local (per instance) explanation setting.","J.

random forest,Using recursive feature elimination in random forest to account for correlated variables in high dimensional data,"Random forest (RF) is a machine-learning method that generally works well with high-dimensional problems and allows for nonlinear relationships between predictors; however, the presence of correlated predictors has been shown to impact its ability to identify strong predictors. The Random Forest-Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm (RF-RFE) mitigates this problem in smaller data sets, but this approach has not been tested in high-dimensional omics data sets. We integrated 202,919 genotypes and 153,422 methylation sites in 680 individuals, and compared the abilities of RF and RF-RFE to detect simulated causal associations, which included simulated genotype–methylation interactions, between these variables and triglyceride levels. Results show that RF was able to identify strong causal variables with a few highly correlated variables, but it did not detect other causal variables. Although RF-RFE decreased the importance of correlated variables, in the presence of many correlated variables, it also decreased the importance of causal variables, making both hard to detect.

random forest,A Detailed Review on Decision Tree and Random Forest,"The decision tree method works by repeatedly dividing the location of features into imaginary limb regions so that each imaginary location provides a basis for making a different approximation. The decision tree system in existence so far applies to various future tasks such as classification and regression. These methods are popular in the field of data science with various benefits. This is due to limitations such as instability of predictions before slight changes in data, and this leads to a major change in the structure of the decision-making tree and has detrimental effects in terms of forecasting. On the other hand, to improve the prediction accuracy of a single base classifier or regressor, multiple decision trees are given parallel training for forecasting purposes and are known as random forests. The random forest technique is an ensemble methods, it comprises of several decision tree which are trained on the subset of data or with the feature subspace, once all the tree are trained, their results are combined together for the purpose of prediction. As random forest is more stable than a decision tree it become more popular in the field of data science and machine learning.

random forest,Geographical random forests: a spatial extension of the random forest algorithm to address spatial heterogeneity in remote sensing and population modelling,"Abstract Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) are being increasingly applied on traditionally geographical topics such as population estimation. Even though RF is a well performing and generalizable algorithm, the vast majority of its implementations is still ‘aspatial’ and may not address spatial heterogenous processes. At the same time, remote sensing (RS) data which are commonly used to model population can be highly spatially heterogeneous. From this scope, we present a novel geographical implementation of RF, named Geographical Random Forest (GRF) as both a predictive and exploratory tool to model population as a function of RS covariates. GRF is a disaggregation of RF into geographical space in the form of local sub-models. From the first empirical results, we conclude that GRF can be more predictive when an appropriate spatial scale is selected to model the data, with reduced residual autocorrelation and lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values.

random forest,The Macroeconomy as a Random Forest,"I develop the macroeconomic random forest (MRF), an algorithm adapting the canonical machine learning (ML) tool, to flexibly model evolving parameters in a linear macro equation. Its main output, generalized time‐varying parameters (GTVPs), is a versatile device nesting many popular nonlinearities (threshold/switching, smooth transition, and structural breaks/change) and allowing for sophisticated new ones. The approach delivers clear forecasting gains over numerous alternatives, predicts the 2008 drastic rise in unemployment, and performs well for inflation. Unlike most ML‐based methods, MRF is directly interpretable—via its GTVPs. For instance, the successful unemployment forecast is due to the influence of forward‐looking variables (e.g., term spreads and housing starts) nearly doubling before every recession.

random forest,Forest Fire Probability Mapping in Eastern Serbia: Logistic Regression versus Random Forest Method,"Forest fire risk has increased globally during the previous decades. The Mediterranean region is traditionally the most at risk in Europe, but continental countries like Serbia have experienced significant economic and ecological losses due to forest fires. To prevent damage to forests and infrastructure, alongside other societal losses, it is necessary to create an effective protection system against fire, which minimizes the harmful effects. Forest fire probability mapping, as one of the basic tools in risk management, allows the allocation of resources for fire suppression, within a fire season, from zones with a lower risk to those under higher threat. Logistic regression (LR) has been used as a standard procedure in forest fire probability mapping, but in the last decade, machine learning methods such as fandom forest (RF) have become more frequent. The main goals in this study were to (i) determine the main explanatory variables for forest fire occurrence for both models, LR and RF, and (ii) map the probability of forest fire occurrence in Eastern Serbia based on LR and RF. The most important variable was drought code, followed by different anthropogenic features depending on the type of the model. The RF models demonstrated better overall predictive ability than LR models. The map produced may increase firefighting efficiency due to the early detection of forest fire and enable resources to be allocated in the eastern part of Serbia, which covers more than one-third of the country’s area.","S.

random forest,Analysis on the Applicability of the Random Forest,"Random forest is a flexible algorithm with a wide range of applications and performs well on a large number of data sets. Besides, Random forest is immune to statistical assumptions as well as preprocessing burden and can handle a large data set with high dimensionality and missing values. Nevertheless, random forest struggles with high-cardinality categorical variables, unbalanced data, time series forecasting, variables interpretation, and is sensitive to hyperparameter. Thus, random forest is relatively suitable for processing high-dimensional data and data with missing variables. Besides, random forest works well with a large amount of data, which is previously unprocessed. Moreover, random forest is an appropriate method, when there are prior statistical assumptions. However, random forest is non-ideal, when processing data with endogenous temporal effects or high-cardinality categorical variables, as well as when the interpretation is the primary goal. Despite the shortcomings of the random forest, there are still some improvements that can be made.

random forest,Testing a New Ensemble Model Based on SVM and Random Forest in Forest Fire Susceptibility Assessment and Its Mapping in Serbia’s Tara National Park,"The main objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the results of an ensemble learning method based on prediction results of support vector machine and random forest methods using Bayesian average. In this study, we generated susceptibility maps of forest fire using supervised machine learning method (support vector machine—SVM) and its comparison with a versatile machine learning algorithm (random forest—RF) and their ensembles. In order to achieve this, first of all, a forest fire inventory map was constructed using Serbian historical forest fire database, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS), Landsat 8 OLI and Worldview-2 satellite images, field surveys, and interpretation of aerial photo images. A total of 126 forest fire locations were identified and randomly divided by a random selection algorithm into two groups, including training (70%) and validation data sets (30%). Forest fire susceptibility maps were prepared using SVM, RF, and their ensemble models using the training dataset and 14 selected different conditioning factors. Finally, to explore the performance of the mentioned models we used the values for area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results depicted that the ensemble model had an AUC = 0.848, followed by the SVM model (AUC = 0.844), and RF model (AUC = 0.834). According to achieved AUC results, it can be deduced that SVM, RF, and their ensemble method had satisfactory performance. The study was applied in the Tara National Park (West Serbia), a region of about 191.7 sq. km distinguished by a very high forest density and a large number of forest fires.","Ljubomir Gigović, H.

random forest,An Intelligent Learning System Based on Random Search Algorithm and Optimized Random Forest Model for Improved Heart Disease Detection,"Heart failure is considered one of the leading cause of death around the world. The diagnosis of heart failure is a challenging task especially in under-developed and developing countries where there is a paucity of human experts and equipments. Hence, different researchers have developed different intelligent systems for automated detection of heart failure. However, most of these methods are facing the problem of overfitting i.e. the recently proposed methods improved heart failure detection accuracy on testing data while compromising heart failure detection accuracy on training data. Consequently, the constructed models overfit to the testing data. In order, to come up with an intelligent system that would show good performance on both training and testing data, in this paper we develop a novel diagnostic system. The proposed diagnostic system uses random search algorithm (RSA) for features selection and random forest model for heart failure prediction. The proposed diagnostic system is optimized using grid search algorithm. Two types of experiments are performed to evaluate the precision of the proposed method. In the first experiment, only random forest model is developed while in the second experiment the proposed RSA based random forest model is developed. Experiments are performed using an online heart failure database namely Cleveland dataset. The proposed method is efficient and less complex than conventional random forest model as it produces 3.3% higher accuracy than conventional random forest model while using only 7 features. Moreover, the proposed method shows better performance than five other state of the art machine learning models. In addition, the proposed method achieved classification accuracy of 93.33% while improving the training accuracy as well. Finally, the proposed method shows better performance than eleven recently proposed methods for heart failure detection.","Ashir Javeed, Shijie Zhou, Yongjian Liao, Iqbal Qasim, A.

random forest,Random forest meteorological normalisation models for Swiss PM 10 trend analysis,"Abstract. Meteorological normalisation is a technique which accounts for changes in meteorology over time in an air quality time series. Controlling for such changes helps support robust trend analysis because there is more certainty that the observed trends are due to changes in emissions or chemistry, not changes in meteorology. Predictive random forest models (RF; a decision tree machine learning technique) were grown for 31 air quality monitoring sites in Switzerland using surface meteorological, synoptic scale, boundary layer height, and time variables to explain daily PM10 concentrations. The RF models were used to calculate meteorologically normalised trends which were formally tested and evaluated using the Theil–Sen estimator. Between 1997 and 2016, significantly decreasing normalised PM10 trends ranged between −0.09 and −1.16 µg m−3 yr−1 with urban traffic sites experiencing the greatest mean decrease in PM10 concentrations at −0.77 µg m−3 yr−1. Similar magnitudes have been reported for normalised PM10 trends for earlier time periods in Switzerland which indicates PM10 concentrations are continuing to decrease at similar rates as in the past. The ability for RF models to be interpreted was leveraged using partial dependence plots to explain the observed trends and relevant physical and chemical processes influencing PM10 concentrations. Notably, two regimes were suggested by the models which cause elevated PM10 concentrations in Switzerland: one related to poor dispersion conditions and a second resulting from high rates of secondary PM generation in deep, photochemically active boundary layers. The RF meteorological normalisation process was found to be robust, user friendly and simple to implement, and readily interpretable which suggests the technique could be useful in many air quality exploratory data analysis situations.","S.

random forest,"Performance Comparison of Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Extreme Learning Machine for Intrusion Detection","Intrusion detection is a fundamental part of security tools, such as adaptive security appliances, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, and firewalls. Various intrusion detection techniques are used, but their performance is an issue. Intrusion detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not efficient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffic data; thus, an efficient classification technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques, namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in classification. The NSL–knowledge discovery and data mining data set is used, which is considered a benchmark in the evaluation of intrusion detection mechanisms.

random forest,Early Detection of Depression: Social Network Analysis and Random Forest Techniques,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) or depression is among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, affecting more than 300 million people globally. Early detection is critical for rapid intervention, which can potentially reduce the escalation of the disorder. Objective This study used data from social media networks to explore various methods of early detection of MDDs based on machine learning. We performed a thorough analysis of the dataset to characterize the subjects’ behavior based on different aspects of their writings: textual spreading, time gap, and time span. Methods We proposed 2 different approaches based on machine learning singleton and dual. The former uses 1 random forest (RF) classifier with 2 threshold functions, whereas the latter uses 2 independent RF classifiers, one to detect depressed subjects and another to identify nondepressed individuals. In both cases, features are defined from textual, semantic, and writing similarities. Results The evaluation follows a time-aware approach that rewards early detections and penalizes late detections. The results show how a dual model performs significantly better than the singleton model and is able to improve current state-of-the-art detection models by more than 10%.

random forest,Random forest-based imputation outperforms other methods for imputing LC-MS metabolomics data: a comparative study,"LC-MS technology makes it possible to measure the relative abundance of numerous molecular features of a sample in single analysis. However, especially non-targeted metabolite profiling approaches generate vast arrays of data that are prone to aberrations such as missing values. No matter the reason for the missing values in the data, coherent and complete data matrix is always a pre-requisite for accurate and reliable statistical analysis. Therefore, there is a need for proper imputation strategies that account for the missingness and reduce the bias in the statistical analysis. Here we present our results after evaluating nine imputation methods in four different percentages of missing values of different origin. The performance of each imputation method was analyzed by Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE). We demonstrated that random forest (RF) had the lowest NRMSE in the estimation of missing values for Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). In case of absent values due to Missing Not at Random (MNAR), the left truncated data was best imputed with minimum value imputation. We also tested the different imputation methods for datasets containing missing data of various origin, and RF was the most accurate method in all cases. The results were obtained by repeating the evaluation process 100 times with the use of metabolomics datasets where the missing values were introduced to represent absent data of different origin. Type and rate of missingness affects the performance and suitability of imputation methods. RF-based imputation method performs best in most of the tested scenarios, including combinations of different types and rates of missingness. Therefore, we recommend using random forest-based imputation for imputing missing metabolomics data, and especially in situations where the types of missingness are not known in advance.","Marietta Kokla, J.

random forest,Improved Random Forest for Classification,"We propose an improved random forest classifier that performs classification with a minimum number of trees. The proposed method iteratively removes some unimportant features. Based on the number of important and unimportant features, we formulate a novel theoretical upper limit on the number of trees to be added to the forest to ensure improvement in classification accuracy. Our algorithm converges with a reduced but important set of features. We prove that further addition of trees or further reduction of features does not improve classification performance. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark data sets. We further use the proposed classifier to detect mitotic nuclei in the histopathological data sets of breast tissues. We also apply our method on the industrial data set of dual-phase steel microstructures to classify different phases. Results of our method on different data sets show significant reduction in an average classification error compared with a number of competing methods.","Angshuman Paul, D. Mukherjee, P.

They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings.

Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, imputation performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting—the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest.

random forest,Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks through the Random Forest Classifier,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are vulnerable to faults because of their deployment in unpredictable and hazardous environments. This makes WSN prone to failures such as software, hardware, and communication failures. Due to the sensor’s limited resources and diverse deployment fields, fault detection in WSNs has become a daunting task. To solve this problem, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifiers are used for classification of gain, offset, spike, data loss, out of bounds, and stuck-at faults at the sensor level. Out of six faults, two of them are induced in the datasets, i.e., spike and data loss faults. The results are compared on the basis of their Detection Accuracy (DA), True Positive Rate (TPR), Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC), and F1-score. In this paper, a comparative analysis is performed among the classifiers mentioned previously on real-world datasets.

Data exchanged over wireless sensor networks is vulnerable to malicious attacks due to the lack of physical defense equipment. Therefore, corresponding schemes of intrusion detection are urgently needed to defend against such attacks. Considering the serious class imbalance of the intrusion dataset, this paper proposes a method of using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset and then uses the random forest algorithm to train the classifier for intrusion detection. The simulations are conducted on a benchmark intrusion dataset, and the accuracy of the random forest algorithm has reached 92.39%, which is higher than other comparison algorithms. After oversampling the minority samples, the accuracy of the random forest combined with the SMOTE has increased to 92.57%. This shows that the proposed algorithm provides an effective solution to solve the problem of class imbalance and improves the performance of intrusion detection.","Xiaopeng Tan, Shaojing Su, Zhiping Huang, Xiaojun Guo, Zhen Zuo, Xiaoyong Sun, Longqing Li",2019.0,141,Italian National Conference on Sensors,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52fb4cfd94f6a409341c4bdea8d2153bfa83b5a2,0.9600000000000009,0.0011457825450999512,random forest wireless sensor networks intrusion detection based on smote and the random forest algorithm with the wide application of wireless sensor networks in military and environmental monitoring security issues have become increasingly prominent data exchanged over wireless sensor networks is vulnerable to malicious attacks due to the lack of physical defense equipment therefore corresponding schemes of intrusion detection are urgently needed to defend against such attacks considering the serious class imbalance of the intrusion dataset this paper proposes a method of using the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote to balance the dataset and then uses the random forest algorithm to train the classifier for intrusion detection the simulations are conducted on a benchmark intrusion dataset and the accuracy of the random forest algorithm has reached 9239 which is higher than other comparison algorithms after oversampling the minority samples the accuracy of the random forest combined with the smote has increased to 9257 this shows that the proposed algorithm provides an effective solution to solve the problem of class imbalance and improves the performance of intrusion detection xiaopeng tan shaojing su zhiping huang xiaojun guo zhen zuo xiaoyong sun longqing li

random forest,AmPEP: Sequence-based prediction of antimicrobial peptides using distribution patterns of amino acid properties and random forest,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates in the fight against multidrug-resistant pathogens owing to AMPs’ broad range of activities and low toxicity. Nonetheless, identification of AMPs through wet-lab experiments is still expensive and time consuming. Here, we propose an accurate computational method for AMP prediction by the random forest algorithm. The prediction model is based on the distribution patterns of amino acid properties along the sequence. Using our collection of large and diverse sets of AMP and non-AMP data (3268 and 166791 sequences, respectively), we evaluated 19 random forest classifiers with different positive:negative data ratios by 10-fold cross-validation. Our optimal model, AmPEP with the 1:3 data ratio, showed high accuracy (96%), Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.99, and the Kappa statistic of 0.9. Descriptor analysis of AMP/non-AMP distributions by means of Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that reduced feature sets (from a full-featured set of 105 to a minimal-feature set of 23) can result in comparable performance in all respects except for some reductions in precision. Furthermore, AmPEP outperformed existing methods in terms of accuracy, MCC, and AUC-ROC when tested on benchmark datasets.","Pratiti Bhadra, Jielu Yan, Jinyan Li, S. Fong, S.

random forest,Random Forest Algorithm for the Classification of Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review,"Objective: Machine learning classification has been the most important computational development in the last years to satisfy the primary need of clinicians for automatic early diagnosis and prognosis. Nowadays, Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for reducing high dimensional and multi-source data in many scientific realms. Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on this field of study. In particular, we constructed an advanced query using boolean operators as follows: (“random forest” OR “random forests”) AND neuroimaging AND (“alzheimer's disease” OR alzheimer's OR alzheimer) AND (prediction OR classification). The query was then searched in four well-known scientific databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: Twelve articles—published between the 2007 and 2017—have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection. The lesson learnt from these works suggest that when RF was applied on multi-modal data for prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion from the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), it produces one of the best accuracies to date. Moreover, the RF has important advantages in terms of robustness to overfitting, ability to handle highly non-linear data, stability in the presence of outliers and opportunity for efficient parallel processing mainly when applied on multi-modality neuroimaging data, such as, MRI morphometric, diffusion tensor imaging, and PET images. Conclusions: We discussed the strengths of RF, considering also possible limitations and by encouraging further studies on the comparisons of this algorithm with other commonly used classification approaches, particularly in the early prediction of the progression from MCI to AD.","Alessia Sarica, A.

random forest,"A Novel Performance Assessment Approach Using Photogrammetric Techniques for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping with Logistic Regression, ANN and Random Forest","Prediction of possible landslide areas is the first stage of landslide hazard mitigation efforts and is also crucial for suitable site selection. Several statistical and machine learning methodologies have been applied for the production of landslide susceptibility maps. However, the performance assessment of such methods have conventionally been carried out by utilizing existing landslide inventories. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performances of landslide susceptibility maps produced with three different machine learning algorithms, i.e., random forest, artificial neural network, and logistic regression, in a recently constructed and activated dam reservoir and assess the external quality of each map by using pre- and post-event photogrammetric datasets. The methodology introduced here was applied using digital surface models generated from aerial photogrammetric flight data acquired before and after the dam construction. Aerial photogrammetric images acquired in 2012 and 2018 (after the dam was filled) were used to produce digital terrain models and orthophotos. The 2012 dataset was used for producing the landslide susceptibility maps and the results were evaluated by comparing the Euclidian distances between the two surface models. The results show that the random forest method outperforms the other two for predicting the future landslides.","E. Sevgen, S. Kocaman, H. A. Nefeslioglu, C.

random forest,AIPpred: Sequence-Based Prediction of Anti-inflammatory Peptides Using Random Forest,"The use of therapeutic peptides in various inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disorders has received considerable attention; however, the identification of anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) through wet-lab experimentation is expensive and often time consuming. Therefore, the development of novel computational methods is needed to identify potential AIP candidates prior to in vitro experimentation. In this study, we proposed a random forest (RF)-based method for predicting AIPs, called AIPpred (AIP predictor in primary amino acid sequences), which was trained with 354 optimal features. First, we systematically studied the contribution of individual composition [amino acid-, dipeptide composition (DPC), amino acid index, chain-transition-distribution, and physicochemical properties] in AIP prediction. Since the performance of the DPC-based model is significantly better than that of other composition-based models, we applied a feature selection protocol on this model and identified the optimal features. AIPpred achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.801 in a 5-fold cross-validation test, which was ∼2% higher than that of the control RF predictor trained with all DPC composition features, indicating the efficiency of the feature selection protocol. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of AIPpred on an independent dataset, with results showing that our method outperformed an existing method, as well as 3 different machine learning methods developed in this study, with an AUC value of 0.814.

object detection,End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers,"We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

However, it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10$\times$ less training epochs.

object detection,FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection,"We propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating overlapping during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often very sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing, surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler.

In this paper, we systematically study neural network architecture design choices for object detection and propose several key optimizations to improve efficiency. First, we propose a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN), which allows easy and fast multi-scale feature fusion; Second, we propose a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the resolution, depth, and width for all backbone, feature network, and box/class prediction networks at the same time. Based on these optimizations and EfficientNet backbones, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called EfficientDet, which consistently achieve much better efficiency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In particular, with single-model and single-scale, our EfficientDetD7 achieves state-of-the-art 52.2 AP on COCO test-dev with 52M parameters and 325B FLOPs, being 4x – 9x smaller and using 13x – 42x fewer FLOPs than previous detector.","Mingxing Tan, Ruoming Pang, Quoc V.

object detection,Cascade R-CNN: Delving Into High Quality Object Detection,"In object detection, an intersection over union (IoU) threshold is required to define positives and negatives. An object detector, trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the challenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is widely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains independently of the baseline detector strength.

In contrast to previous region-based detectors such as Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds of times, our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all computation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal, we propose position-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma between translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in object detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional image classifier backbones, such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets), for object detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g., 83.6% mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet.

The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes.

But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive.

This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications.

object detection,Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review,"Due to object detection’s close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions.

object detection,YOLOv10: Real-Time End-to-End Object Detection,"Over the past years, YOLOs have emerged as the predominant paradigm in the field of real-time object detection owing to their effective balance between computational cost and detection performance. Researchers have explored the architectural designs, optimization objectives, data augmentation strategies, and others for YOLOs, achieving notable progress. However, the reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of YOLOs and adversely impacts the inference latency. Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8$\times$ faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8$\times$ smaller number of parameters and FLOPs.

object detection,Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks,"State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

object detection,"You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection","We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.","Joseph Redmon, S. Divvala, Ross B.

object detection,PointPillars: Fast Encoders for Object Detection From Point Clouds,"Object detection in point clouds is an important aspect of many robotics applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider the problem of encoding a point cloud into a format appropriate for a downstream detection pipeline. Recent literature suggests two types of encoders; fixed encoders tend to be fast but sacrifice accuracy, while encoders that are learned from data are more accurate, but slower. In this work, we propose PointPillars, a novel encoder which utilizes PointNets to learn a representation of point clouds organized in vertical columns (pillars). While the encoded features can be used with any standard 2D convolutional detection architecture, we further propose a lean downstream network. Extensive experimentation shows that PointPillars outperforms previous encoders with respect to both speed and accuracy by a large margin. Despite only using lidar, our full detection pipeline significantly outperforms the state of the art, even among fusion methods, with respect to both the 3D and bird’s eye view KITTI benchmarks. This detection performance is achieved while running at 62 Hz: a 2 - 4 fold runtime improvement. A faster version of our method matches the state of the art at 105 Hz. These benchmarks suggest that PointPillars is an appropriate encoding for object detection in point clouds.","Alex H.

object detection,VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection,"Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.","Yin Zhou, Oncel Tuzel",2017.0,3942,2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80f5ee8578ee76e2c17824f211762ffec7e029d4,0.9439999999999991,0.03203315455875183,object detection voxelnet endtoend learning for point cloud based 3d object detection accurate detection of objects in 3d point clouds is a central problem in many applications such as autonomous navigation housekeeping robots and augmentedvirtual reality to interface a highly sparse lidar point cloud with a region proposal network rpn most existing efforts have focused on handcrafted feature representations for example a birds eye view projection in this work we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3d point clouds and propose voxelnet a generic 3d detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage endtoend trainable deep network specifically voxelnet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3d voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding vfe layer in this way the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation which is then connected to a rpn to generate detections experiments on the kitti car detection benchmark show that voxelnet outperforms the stateoftheart lidar based 3d detection methods by a large margin furthermore our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries leading to encouraging results in 3d detection of pedestrians and cyclists based on only lidar yin zhou oncel tuzel
object detection,DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection,"The YOLO series has become the most popular frame-work for real-time object detection due to its reasonable trade-off between speed and accuracy. However, we observe that the speed and accuracy of YOLOs are negatively affected by the NMS. Recently, end-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have provided an alternative to eliminating NMS. Nevertheless, the high computational cost limits their practicality and hinders them from fully exploiting the advantage of excluding NMS. In this paper, we propose the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge that addresses the above dilemma. We build RT-DETR in two steps, drawing on the advanced DETR: first we focus on maintaining accuracy while improving speed, followed by maintaining speed while improving accuracy. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to expeditiously process multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion to improve speed. Then, we propose the uncertainty-minimal query selection to provide high-quality initial queries to the decoder, thereby improving accuracy. In addition, RT-DETR supports flexible speed tuning by adjusting the number of decoder layers to adapt to various scenarios without retraining. Our RT-DETR-R50 /R101 achieves 53.1% 154.3% AP on COCO and 108 /74 FPS on T4 GPU, outperforming previously advanced YOLOs in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, RT-DETR-R50 outperforms DINO-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and about 21 times in FPS. After pre-training with Objects365, RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 55.3% 156.2% AP.

object detection,Rich Feature Hierarchies for Accurate Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation,"Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features.

object detection,CenterNet: Keypoint Triplets for Object Detection,"In object detection, keypoint-based approaches often experience the drawback of a large number of incorrect object bounding boxes, arguably due to the lack of an additional assessment inside cropped regions. This paper presents an efficient solution that explores the visual patterns within individual cropped regions with minimal costs. We build our framework upon a representative one-stage keypoint-based detector named CornerNet. Our approach, named CenterNet, detects each object as a triplet, rather than a pair, of keypoints, which improves both precision and recall. Accordingly, we design two customized modules, cascade corner pooling, and center pooling, that enrich information collected by both the top-left and bottom-right corners and provide more recognizable information from the central regions. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0 %, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors by at least 4.9%.

object detection,Remote Sensing Object Detection in the Deep Learning Era - A Review,"Given the large volume of remote sensing images collected daily, automatic object detection and segmentation have been a consistent need in Earth observation (EO). However, objects of interest vary in shape, size, appearance, and reflecting properties. This is not only reflected by the fact that these objects exhibit differences due to their geographical diversity but also by the fact that these objects appear differently in images collected from different sensors (optical and radar) and platforms (satellite, aerial, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)). Although there exists a plethora of object detection methods in the area of remote sensing, given the very fast development of prevalent deep learning methods, there is still a lack of recent updates for object detection methods. In this paper, we aim to provide an update that informs researchers about the recent development of object detection methods and their close sibling in the deep learning era, instance segmentation. The integration of these methods will cover approaches to data at different scales and modalities, such as optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and digital surface models (DSM). Specific emphasis will be placed on approaches addressing data and label limitations in this deep learning era. Further, we survey examples of remote sensing applications that benefited from automatic object detection and discuss future trends of the automatic object detection in EO.","Shengxi Gui, Shuang Song, Rongjun Qin, Yang Tang",2024.0,138,Remote Sensing,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad55e35d8d2b2250fab4099b0d622aa42ddcde04,1.0,0.0011214041930765481,object detection remote sensing object detection in the deep learning era a review given the large volume of remote sensing images collected daily automatic object detection and segmentation have been a consistent need in earth observation eo however objects of interest vary in shape size appearance and reflecting properties this is not only reflected by the fact that these objects exhibit differences due to their geographical diversity but also by the fact that these objects appear differently in images collected from different sensors optical and radar and platforms satellite aerial and unmanned aerial vehicles uav although there exists a plethora of object detection methods in the area of remote sensing given the very fast development of prevalent deep learning methods there is still a lack of recent updates for object detection methods in this paper we aim to provide an update that informs researchers about the recent development of object detection methods and their close sibling in the deep learning era instance segmentation the integration of these methods will cover approaches to data at different scales and modalities such as optical synthetic aperture radar sar images and digital surface models dsm specific emphasis will be placed on approaches addressing data and label limitations in this deep learning era further we survey examples of remote sensing applications that benefited from automatic object detection and discuss future trends of the automatic object detection in eo shengxi gui shuang song rongjun qin yang tang
object detection,Cut and Learn for Unsupervised Object Detection and Instance Segmentation,"We propose Cut-and-LEaRn (CutLER), a simple approach for training unsupervised object detection and seg-mentation models. We leverage the property of self-supervised models to ‘discover’ objects without supervision and amplify it to train a state-of-the-art localization model without any human labels. CutLER first uses our proposed MaskCut approach to generate coarse masks for multiple objects in an image, and then learns a detector on these masks using our robust loss function. We further improve performance by self-training the model on its predictions. Compared to prior work, CutLER is simpler, compatible with different detection architectures, and detects multiple objects. CutLER is also a zero-shot unsupervised detector and improves detection performance AP50 by over 2.7× on 11 benchmarks across domains like video frames, paintings, sketches, etc. With finetuning, CutLER serves as a low-shot detector surpassing MoCo-v2 by 7.3% Apbox and 6.6% Apmask on COCO when training with 5% labels.","Xudong Wang, Rohit Girdhar, Stella X.

object detection,Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation,"Formulation of the problem. Over the past few years, there has been little progress in object detection techniques. The most efficient are complex computational ensemble methods, which usually combine several low-level image properties with high-level properties. However, every day interest in artificial intelligence is growing, and the idea of using neural networks on board a spacecraft, with the possibility of making decisions and issuing one-time commands, is very promising, since it makes it possible to analyze a large data stream in real time without resorting to ground station, thereby not losing information when transmitting a packet. The purpose of the work is to conduct research on the possibility of effective use of modern models of neural networks, to develop a methodology for their use in the problem of object detection and analysis of the element base for hardware implementation with the possibility of using convolutional neural networks for thermovideotelemetry on board a spacecraft. Results of work. An approach has been formulated that combines two key ideas: 1) application of high-throughput convolutional neural networks for downward processing of image regions in order to localize and segment objects; 2) preliminary training for the auxiliary task, followed by fine tuning of the domain, which gives a significant increase in performance in the case when the training data is insufficient. The analysis of the element base for the possibility of hardware implementation of neural networks on board a spacecraft using electrical radio products of domestic and foreign production is carried out.

object detection,TPH-YOLOv5: Improved YOLOv5 Based on Transformer Prediction Head for Object Detection on Drone-captured Scenarios,"Object detection on drone-captured scenarios is a recent popular task. As drones always navigate in different altitudes, the object scale varies violently, which burdens the optimization of networks. Moreover, high-speed and low-altitude flight bring in the motion blur on the densely packed objects, which leads to great challenge of object distinction. To solve the two issues mentioned above, we propose TPH-YOLOv5. Based on YOLOv5, we add one more prediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the prediction potential with self-attention mechanism. We also integrate convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on scenarios with dense objects. To achieve more improvement of our proposed TPH-YOLOv5, we provide bags of useful strategies such as data augmentation, multi-scale testing, multi-model integration and utilizing extra classifier. Extensive experiments on dataset VisDrone2021 show that TPH-YOLOv5 have good performance with impressive interpretability on drone-captured scenarios. On DET-test-challenge dataset, the AP result of TPH-YOLOv5 are 39.18%, which is better than previous SOTA method (DPNetV3) by 1.81%. On VisDrone Challenge 2021, TPH-YOLOv5 wins 5th place and achieves well-matched results with 1st place model (AP 39.43%).

object detection,DOTA: A Large-Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images,"Object detection is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object detection in natural scenes, such successes have been slow to aerial imagery, not only because of the huge variation in the scale, orientation and shape of the object instances on the earth's surface, but also due to the scarcity of well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes. To advance object detection research in Earth Vision, also known as Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, we introduce a large-scale Dataset for Object deTection in Aerial images (DOTA). To this end, we collect 2806 aerial images from different sensors and platforms. Each image is of the size about 4000 Ã— 4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains 188, 282 instances, each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.) quadrilateral. To build a baseline for object detection in Earth Vision, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA.

object detection,Scaling Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,"Open-vocabulary object detection has benefited greatly from pretrained vision-language models, but is still limited by the amount of available detection training data. While detection training data can be expanded by using Web image-text pairs as weak supervision, this has not been done at scales comparable to image-level pretraining. Here, we scale up detection data with self-training, which uses an existing detector to generate pseudo-box annotations on image-text pairs. Major challenges in scaling self-training are the choice of label space, pseudo-annotation filtering, and training efficiency. We present the OWLv2 model and OWL-ST self-training recipe, which address these challenges. OWLv2 surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art open-vocabulary detectors already at comparable training scales (~10M examples). However, with OWL-ST, we can scale to over 1B examples, yielding further large improvement: With an L/14 architecture, OWL-ST improves AP on LVIS rare classes, for which the model has seen no human box annotations, from 31.2% to 44.6% (43% relative improvement).

object detection,Frustum PointNets for 3D Object Detection from RGB-D Data,"In this work, we study 3D object detection from RGBD data in both indoor and outdoor scenes. While previous methods focus on images or 3D voxels, often obscuring natural 3D patterns and invariances of 3D data, we directly operate on raw point clouds by popping up RGB-D scans. However, a key challenge of this approach is how to efficiently localize objects in point clouds of large-scale scenes (region proposal). Instead of solely relying on 3D proposals, our method leverages both mature 2D object detectors and advanced 3D deep learning for object localization, achieving efficiency as well as high recall for even small objects. Benefited from learning directly in raw point clouds, our method is also able to precisely estimate 3D bounding boxes even under strong occlusion or with very sparse points.

object detection,Center-based 3D Object Detection and Tracking,"Three-dimensional objects are commonly represented as 3D boxes in a point-cloud. This representation mimics the well-studied image-based 2D bounding-box detection but comes with additional challenges. Objects in a 3D world do not follow any particular orientation, and box-based detectors have difficulties enumerating all orientations or fitting an axis-aligned bounding box to rotated objects. In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. CenterPoint achieved state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for both 3D detection and tracking, with 65.5 NDS and 63.8 AMOTA for a single model.

object detection,Generalized Focal Loss: Learning Qualified and Distributed Bounding Boxes for Dense Object Detection,"One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense classification and localization. The classification is usually optimized by Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta distribution. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the predicted quality facilitates the classification to improve detection performance. This paper delves into the representations of the above three fundamental elements: quality estimation, classification and localization. Two problems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) the inconsistent usage of the quality estimation and classification between training and inference and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization when there is ambiguity and uncertainty in complex scenes. To address the problems, we design new representations for these elements. Specifically, we merge the quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint representation of localization quality and classification, and use a vector to represent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations eliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible distribution in real data, but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the scope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the continuous version for successful optimization. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0\% AP using ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5\%) and ATSS (43.6\%) with higher or comparable inference speed, under the same backbone and training settings.

object detection,Real-Time Flying Object Detection with YOLOv8,"This paper presents a generalized model for real-time detection of flying objects that can be used for transfer learning and further research, as well as a refined model that achieves state-of-the-art results for flying object detection. We achieve this by training our first (generalized) model on a data set containing 40 different classes of flying objects, forcing the model to extract abstract feature representations. We then perform transfer learning with these learned parameters on a data set more representative of real world environments (i.e. higher frequency of occlusion, very small spatial sizes, rotations, etc.) to generate our refined model. Object detection of flying objects remains challenging due to large variances of object spatial sizes/aspect ratios, rate of speed, occlusion, and clustered backgrounds. To address some of the presented challenges while simultaneously maximizing performance, we utilize the current state-of-the-art single-shot detector, YOLOv8, in an attempt to find the best trade-off between inference speed and mean average precision (mAP). While YOLOv8 is being regarded as the new state-of-the-art, an official paper has not been released as of yet.

object detection,VoxelNeXt: Fully Sparse VoxelNet for 3D Object Detection and Tracking,"3D object detectors usually rely on hand-crafted proxies, e.g., anchors or centers, and translate well-studied 2D frameworks to 3D. Thus, sparse voxel features need to be densified and processed by dense prediction heads, which inevitably costs extra computation. In this paper, we instead propose VoxelNext for fully sparse 3D object detection. Our core insight is to predict objects directly based on sparse voxel features, without relying on hand-crafted proxies. Our strong sparse convolutional network VoxelNeXt detects and tracks 3D objects through voxel features entirely. It is an elegant and efficient framework, with no need for sparse-to-dense conversion or NMS post-processing. Our method achieves a better speed-accuracy trade-off than other mainframe detectors on the nuScenes dataset. For the first time, we show that a fully sparse voxel-based representation works decently for LIDAR 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on nuScenes, Waymo, and Argoverse2 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Without bells and whistles, our model outperforms all existing LIDAR methods on the nuScenes tracking test benchmark.

object detection,Sparse R-CNN: End-to-End Object Detection with Learnable Proposals,"We present Sparse R-CNN, a purely sparse method for object detection in images. Existing works on object detection heavily rely on dense object candidates, such as k anchor boxes pre-defined on all grids of image feature map of size H × W. In our method, however, a fixed sparse set of learned object proposals, total length of N, are provided to object recognition head to perform classification and location. By eliminating HWk (up to hundreds of thousands) hand-designed object candidates to N (e.g. 100) learnable proposals, Sparse R-CNN completely avoids all efforts related to object candidates design and many-to-one label assignment. More importantly, final predictions are directly output without non-maximum suppression post-procedure. Sparse R-CNN demonstrates accuracy, run-time and training convergence performance on par with the well-established detector baselines on the challenging COCO dataset, e.g., achieving 45.0 AP in standard 3× training schedule and running at 22 fps using ResNet-50 FPN model.

object detection,Camouflaged Object Detection with Feature Decomposition and Edge Reconstruction,"Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to address the tough issue of identifying camouflaged objects visually blended into the surrounding backgrounds. COD is a challenging task due to the intrinsic similarity of camouflaged objects with the background, as well as their ambiguous boundaries. Existing approaches to this problem have developed various techniques to mimic the human visual system. Albeit effective in many cases, these methods still struggle when camouflaged objects are so deceptive to the vision system. In this paper, we propose the FEature Decomposition and Edge Reconstruction (FEDER) model for COD. The FEDER model addresses the intrinsic similarity of foreground and background by decomposing the features into different frequency bands using learnable wavelets. It then focuses on the most informative bands to mine subtle cues that differentiate foreground and background. To achieve this, a frequency attention module and a guidance-based feature aggregation module are developed. To combat the ambiguous boundary problem, we propose to learn an auxiliary edge reconstruction task alongside the COD task. We design an ordinary differential equation-inspired edge reconstruction module that generates exact edges. By learning the auxiliary task in conjunction with the COD task, the FEDER model can generate precise prediction maps with accurate object boundaries. Experiments show that our FEDER model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with cheaper computational and memory costs.

Our work is based on a key observation -- depth estimation in recent approaches is surprisingly inadequate given the fact that depth is essential to camera 3D detection. Our BEVDepth resolves this by leveraging explicit depth supervision. A camera-awareness depth estimation module is also introduced to facilitate the depth predicting capability. Besides, we design a novel Depth Refinement Module to counter the side effects carried by imprecise feature unprojection. Aided by customized Efficient Voxel Pooling and multi-frame mechanism, BEVDepth achieves the new state-of-the-art 60.9% NDS on the challenging nuScenes test set while maintaining high efficiency.

The network is composed of two subnetworks: one for 3D object proposal generation and another for multi-view feature fusion. The proposal network generates 3D candidate boxes efficiently from the birds eye view representation of 3D point cloud. We design a deep fusion scheme to combine region-wise features from multiple views and enable interactions between intermediate layers of different paths.

object detection,Open-vocabulary Object Detection via Vision and Language Knowledge Distillation,"We aim at advancing open-vocabulary object detection, which detects objects described by arbitrary text inputs. The fundamental challenge is the availability of training data. It is costly to further scale up the number of classes contained in existing object detection datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose ViLD, a training method via Vision and Language knowledge Distillation. Our method distills the knowledge from a pretrained open-vocabulary image classification model (teacher) into a two-stage detector (student). Specifically, we use the teacher model to encode category texts and image regions of object proposals. Then we train a student detector, whose region embeddings of detected boxes are aligned with the text and image embeddings inferred by the teacher. We benchmark on LVIS by holding out all rare categories as novel categories that are not seen during training. ViLD obtains 16.1 mask AP$_r$ with a ResNet-50 backbone, even outperforming the supervised counterpart by 3.8. When trained with a stronger teacher model ALIGN, ViLD achieves 26.3 AP$_r$. The model can directly transfer to other datasets without finetuning, achieving 72.2 AP$_{50}$ on PASCAL VOC, 36.6 AP on COCO and 11.8 AP on Objects365. On COCO, ViLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.8 on novel AP and 11.4 on overall AP.

object detection,Exploring Plain Vision Transformer Backbones for Object Detection,"We explore the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone network for object detection. This design enables the original ViT architecture to be fine-tuned for object detection without needing to redesign a hierarchical backbone for pre-training. With minimal adaptations for fine-tuning, our plain-backbone detector can achieve competitive results. Surprisingly, we observe: (i) it is sufficient to build a simple feature pyramid from a single-scale feature map (without the common FPN design) and (ii) it is sufficient to use window attention (without shifting) aided with very few cross-window propagation blocks. With plain ViT backbones pre-trained as Masked Autoencoders (MAE), our detector, named ViTDet, can compete with the previous leading methods that were all based on hierarchical backbones, reaching up to 61.3 AP_box on the COCO dataset using only ImageNet-1K pre-training.

object detection,Large Selective Kernel Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection,"Recent research on remote sensing object detection has largely focused on improving the representation of oriented bounding boxes but has overlooked the unique prior knowledge presented in remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because tiny remote sensing objects may be mistakenly detected without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes the lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet). LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing object detection. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard benchmarks, i.e., HRSC2016 (98.46% mAP), DOTA-v1.0 (81.85% mAP), and FAIR1M-v1.0 (47.87% mAP).","Yuxuan Li, Qibin Hou, Zhaohui Zheng, Mingmei Cheng, Jian Yang, Xiang Li",2023.0,345,IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f10bf6b453bb47a8eef53063885b5bd5a42268bd,0.9920000000000009,0.0028035104826913703,object detection large selective kernel network for remote sensing object detection recent research on remote sensing object detection has largely focused on improving the representation of oriented bounding boxes but has overlooked the unique prior knowledge presented in remote sensing scenarios such prior knowledge can be useful because tiny remote sensing objects may be mistakenly detected without referencing a sufficiently longrange context which can vary for different objects this paper considers these priors and proposes the lightweight large selective kernel network lsknet lsknet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios to our knowledge large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing object detection without bells and whistles our lightweight lsknet sets new stateoftheart scores on standard benchmarks ie hrsc2016 9846 map dotav10 8185 map and fair1mv10 4787 map yuxuan li qibin hou zhaohui zheng mingmei cheng jian yang xiang li
object detection,Dense Distinct Query for End-to-End Object Detection,"One-to-one label assignment in object detection has successfully obviated the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS) as postprocessing and makes the pipeline end-to-end. However, it triggers a new dilemma as the widely used sparse queries cannot guarantee a high recall, while dense queries inevitably bring more similar queries and encounter optimization difficulties. As both sparse and dense queries are problematic, then what are the expected queries in end-to-end object detection? This paper shows that the solution should be Dense Distinct Queries (DDQ). Concretely, we first lay dense queries like traditional detectors and then select distinct ones for one-to-one assignments. DDQ blends the advantages of traditional and recent end-to-end detectors and significantly improves the performance of various detectors including FCN, R-CNN, and DETRs. Most impressively, DDQ-DETR achieves 52.1 AP on MS-COCO dataset within 12 epochs using a ResNet-50 backbone, outperforming all existing detectors in the same setting. DDQ also shares the benefit of end-to-end detectors in crowded scenes and achieves 93.8 AP on Crowd-Human. We hope DDQ can inspire researchers to consider the complementarity between traditional methods and end-to-end detectors.

object detection,PV-RCNN: Point-Voxel Feature Set Abstraction for 3D Object Detection,"We present a novel and high-performance 3D object detection framework, named PointVoxel-RCNN (PV-RCNN), for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. Our proposed method deeply integrates both 3D voxel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and PointNet-based set abstraction to learn more discriminative point cloud features. It takes advantages of efficient learning and high-quality proposals of the 3D voxel CNN and the flexible receptive fields of the PointNet-based networks. Specifically, the proposed framework summarizes the 3D scene with a 3D voxel CNN into a small set of keypoints via a novel voxel set abstraction module to save follow-up computations and also to encode representative scene features. Given the high-quality 3D proposals generated by the voxel CNN, the RoI-grid pooling is proposed to abstract proposal-specific features from the keypoints to the RoI-grid points via keypoint set abstraction. Compared with conventional pooling operations, the RoI-grid feature points encode much richer context information for accurately estimating object confidences and locations.

object detection,TransFusion: Robust LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection with Transformers,"LiDAR and camera are two important sensors for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Despite the increasing popularity of sensor fusion in this field, the robustness against inferior image conditions, e.g., bad illumination and sensor misalignment, is under-explored. Existing fusion methods are easily affected by such conditions, mainly due to a hard association of LiDAR points and image pixels, established by calibration matrices. We propose TransFusion, a robust solution to LiDAR-camera fusion with a soft-association mechanism to handle inferior image conditions. Specifically, our TransFusion consists of convolutional backbones and a detection head based on a transformer decoder. The first layer of the decoder predicts initial bounding boxes from a LiDAR point cloud using a sparse set of object queries, and its second decoder layer adaptively fuses the object queries with useful image features, leveraging both spatial and contextual relationships. The attention mechanism of the transformer enables our model to adaptively determine where and what information should be taken from the image, leading to a robust and effective fusion strategy. We additionally design an image-guided query initialization strategy to deal with objects that are difficult to detect in point clouds.

object detection,Target-aware Dual Adversarial Learning and a Multi-scenario Multi-Modality Benchmark to Fuse Infrared and Visible for Object Detection,"This study addresses the issue of fusing infrared and visible images that appear differently for object detection. Aiming at generating an image of high visual quality, previous approaches discover commons underlying the two modalities and fuse upon the common space either by iterative optimization or deep networks. These approaches neglect that modality differences implying the complementary information are extremely important for both fusion and subsequent detection task. This paper proposes a bilevel optimization formulation for the joint problem of fusion and detection, and then unrolls to a target-aware Dual Adversarial Learning (TarDAL) network for fusion and a commonly used detection network. The fusion network with one generator and dual discriminators seeks commons while learning from differences, which preserves structural information of targets from the infrared and textural details from the visible. Furthermore, we build a synchronized imaging system with calibrated infrared and optical sensors, and collect currently the most comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of scenarios.

object detection,BEVDet4D: Exploit Temporal Cues in Multi-camera 3D Object Detection,"Single frame data contains finite information which limits the performance of the existing vision-based multi-camera 3D object detection paradigms. For fundamentally pushing the performance boundary in this area, a novel paradigm dubbed BEVDet4D is proposed to lift the scalable BEVDet paradigm from the spatial-only 3D space to the spatial-temporal 4D space. We upgrade the naive BEVDet framework with a few modifications just for fusing the feature from the previous frame with the corresponding one in the current frame. In this way, with negligible additional computing budget, we enable BEVDet4D to access the temporal cues by querying and comparing the two candidate features. Beyond this, we simplify the task of velocity prediction by removing the factors of ego-motion and time in the learning target. As a result, BEVDet4D with robust generalization performance reduces the velocity error by up to -62.9%. This makes the vision-based methods, for the first time, become comparable with those relied on LiDAR or radar in this aspect. On challenge benchmark nuScenes, we report a new record of 54.5% NDS with the high-performance configuration dubbed BEVDet4D-Base, which surpasses the previous leading method BEVDet-Base by +7.3% NDS.

object detection,DETR3D: 3D Object Detection from Multi-view Images via 3D-to-2D Queries,"We introduce a framework for multi-camera 3D object detection. In contrast to existing works, which estimate 3D bounding boxes directly from monocular images or use depth prediction networks to generate input for 3D object detection from 2D information, our method manipulates predictions directly in 3D space. Our architecture extracts 2D features from multiple camera images and then uses a sparse set of 3D object queries to index into these 2D features, linking 3D positions to multi-view images using camera transformation matrices. Finally, our model makes a bounding box prediction per object query, using a set-to-set loss to measure the discrepancy between the ground-truth and the prediction. This top-down approach outperforms its bottom-up counterpart in which object bounding box prediction follows per-pixel depth estimation, since it does not suffer from the compounding error introduced by a depth prediction model. Moreover, our method does not require post-processing such as non-maximum suppression, dramatically improving inference speed.

In inference, the model refines a set of randomly generated boxes to the output results in a progressive way. Our work possesses an appealing property of flexibility, which enables the dynamic number of boxes and iterative evaluation. The extensive experiments on the standard benchmarks show that DiffusionDet achieves favorable performance compared to previous well-established detectors.

It makes use of the query embeddings from DINO to dot-product a high-resolution pixel embedding map to predict a set of binary masks.

object detection,Learning to Prompt for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Vision-Language Model,"Recently, vision-language pre-training shows great potential in open-vocabulary object detection, where detectors trained on base classes are devised for detecting new classes. The class text embedding is firstly generated by feeding prompts to the text encoder of a pre-trained vision-language model. It is then used as the region classifier to supervise the training of a detector. The key element that leads to the success of this model is the proper prompt, which requires careful words tuning and ingenious design. To avoid laborious prompt engineering, there are some prompt representation learning methods being proposed for the image classification task, which however can only be sub-optimal solutions when applied to the detection task. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, detection prompt (DetPro), to learn continuous prompt representations for open-vocabulary object detection based on the pre-trained vision-language model. Different from the previous classification-oriented methods, DetPro has two highlights: 1) a background interpretation scheme to include the proposals in image background into the prompt training; 2) a context grading scheme to separate proposals in image foreground for tailored prompt training. We assemble DetPro with ViLD, a recent state-of-the-art openworld object detector, and conduct experiments on the LVIS as well as transfer learning on the Pascal VOC, COCO, Objects365 datasets. Experimental results show that our DetPro outperforms the baseline ViLD [7] in all settings, e.g., +3.4 APbox and +3.0 APmask improvements on the novel classes of LVIS.

object detection,DC-YOLOv8: Small-Size Object Detection Algorithm Based on Camera Sensor,"Traditional camera sensors rely on human eyes for observation. However, human eyes are prone to fatigue when observing objects of different sizes for a long time in complex scenes, and human cognition is limited, which often leads to judgment errors and greatly reduces efficiency. Object recognition technology is an important technology used to judge the object’s category on a camera sensor. In order to solve this problem, a small-size object detection algorithm for special scenarios was proposed in this paper. The advantage of this algorithm is that it not only has higher precision for small-size object detection but also can ensure that the detection accuracy for each size is not lower than that of the existing algorithm. There are three main innovations in this paper, as follows: (1) A new downsampling method which could better preserve the context feature information is proposed. (2) The feature fusion network is improved to effectively combine shallow information and deep information. (3) A new network structure is proposed to effectively improve the detection accuracy of the model. From the point of view of detection accuracy, it is better than YOLOX, YOLOR, YOLOv3, scaled YOLOv5, YOLOv7-Tiny, and YOLOv8. Three authoritative public datasets are used in these experiments: (a) In the Visdron dataset (small-size objects), the map, precision, and recall ratios of DC-YOLOv8 are 2.5%, 1.9%, and 2.1% higher than those of YOLOv8s, respectively. (b) On the Tinyperson dataset (minimal-size objects), the map, precision, and recall ratios of DC-YOLOv8 are 1%, 0.2%, and 1.2% higher than those of YOLOv8s, respectively. (c) On the PASCAL VOC2007 dataset (normal-size objects), the map, precision, and recall ratios of DC-YOLOv8 are 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.4% higher than those of YOLOv8s, respectively.","Haitong Lou, Xuehu Duan, Junmei Guo, Haiying Liu, J.

object detection,UAV-YOLOv8: A Small-Object-Detection Model Based on Improved YOLOv8 for UAV Aerial Photography Scenarios,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a crucial role in civil, commercial, and military domains. However, the high proportion of small objects in UAV images and the limited platform resources lead to the low accuracy of most of the existing detection models embedded in UAVs, and it is difficult to strike a good balance between detection performance and resource consumption. To alleviate the above problems, we optimize YOLOv8 and propose an object detection model based on UAV aerial photography scenarios, called UAV-YOLOv8. Firstly, Wise-IoU (WIoU) v3 is used as a bounding box regression loss, and a wise gradient allocation strategy makes the model focus more on common-quality samples, thus improving the localization ability of the model. Secondly, an attention mechanism called BiFormer is introduced to optimize the backbone network, which improves the model’s attention to critical information. Finally, we design a feature processing module named Focal FasterNet block (FFNB) and propose two new detection scales based on this module, which makes the shallow features and deep features fully integrated. The proposed multiscale feature fusion network substantially increased the detection performance of the model and reduces the missed detection rate of small objects. The experimental results show that our model has fewer parameters compared to the baseline model and has a mean detection accuracy higher than the baseline model by 7.7%. Compared with other mainstream models, the overall performance of our model is much better. The proposed method effectively improves the ability to detect small objects. There is room to optimize the detection effectiveness of our model for small and feature-less objects (such as bicycle-type vehicles), as we will address in subsequent research.","G.

object detection,Deep Hough Voting for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds,"Current 3D object detection methods are heavily influenced by 2D detectors. In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird's eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data -- samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space -- we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency.

object detection,BEVDet: High-performance Multi-camera 3D Object Detection in Bird-Eye-View,"Autonomous driving perceives its surroundings for decision making, which is one of the most complex scenarios in visual perception. The success of paradigm innovation in solving the 2D object detection task inspires us to seek an elegant, feasible, and scalable paradigm for fundamentally pushing the performance boundary in this area. To this end, we contribute the BEVDet paradigm in this paper. BEVDet performs 3D object detection in Bird-Eye-View (BEV), where most target values are defined and route planning can be handily performed. We merely reuse existing modules to build its framework but substantially develop its performance by constructing an exclusive data augmentation strategy and upgrading the Non-Maximum Suppression strategy. In the experiment, BEVDet offers an excellent trade-off between accuracy and time-efficiency. As a fast version, BEVDet-Tiny scores 31.2% mAP and 39.2% NDS on the nuScenes val set. It is comparable with FCOS3D, but requires just 11% computational budget of 215.3 GFLOPs and runs 9.2 times faster at 15.6 FPS.

object detection,AFPN: Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection,"Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies. We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that our method achieves more competitive results than other state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks.

object detection,Simple Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Vision Transformers,"Combining simple architectures with large-scale pre-training has led to massive improvements in image classification. For object detection, pre-training and scaling approaches are less well established, especially in the long-tailed and open-vocabulary setting, where training data is relatively scarce. In this paper, we propose a strong recipe for transferring image-text models to open-vocabulary object detection. We use a standard Vision Transformer architecture with minimal modifications, contrastive image-text pre-training, and end-to-end detection fine-tuning. Our analysis of the scaling properties of this setup shows that increasing image-level pre-training and model size yield consistent improvements on the downstream detection task.

object detection,Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection,"Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently. However, existing works have primarily focused on image classification tasks and neglected object detection which requires more annotation effort. In this work, we revisit the Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SS-OD) and identify the pseudo-labeling bias issue in SS-OD. To address this, we introduce Unbiased Teacher, a simple yet effective approach that jointly trains a student and a gradually progressing teacher in a mutually-beneficial manner. Together with a class-balance loss to downweight overly confident pseudo-labels, Unbiased Teacher consistently improved state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on COCO-standard, COCO-additional, and VOC datasets. Specifically, Unbiased Teacher achieves 6.8 absolute mAP improvements against state-of-the-art method when using 1% of labeled data on MS-COCO, achieves around 10 mAP improvements against the supervised baseline when using only 0.5, 1, 2% of labeled data on MS-COCO.","Yen-Cheng Liu, Chih-Yao Ma, Zijian He, Chia-Wen Kuo, Kan Chen, Peizhao Zhang, Bichen Wu, Z.

object detection,Cascade R-CNN: High Quality Object Detection and Instance Segmentation,"In object detection, the intersection over union (IoU) threshold is frequently used to define positives/negatives. The threshold used to train a detector defines its quality. While the commonly used threshold of 0.5 leads to noisy (low-quality) detections, detection performance frequently degrades for larger thresholds. This paradox of high-quality detection has two causes: 1) overfitting, due to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds, and 2) inference-time quality mismatch between detector and test hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, composed of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed to address these problems. The detectors are trained sequentially, using the output of a detector as training set for the next. This resampling progressively improves hypotheses quality, guaranteeing a positive training set of equivalent size for all detectors and minimizing overfitting. The same cascade is applied at inference, to eliminate quality mismatches between hypotheses and detectors. An implementation of the Cascade R-CNN without bells or whistles achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset, and significantly improves high-quality detection on generic and specific object datasets, including VOC, KITTI, CityPerson, and WiderFace. Finally, the Cascade R-CNN is generalized to instance segmentation, with nontrivial improvements over the Mask R-CNN.","Zhaowei Cai, N.

object detection,TOOD: Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection,"One-stage object detection is commonly implemented by optimizing two sub-tasks: object classification and localization, using heads with two parallel branches, which might lead to a certain level of spatial misalignment in predictions between the two tasks. In this work, we propose a Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that explicitly aligns the two tasks in a learning-based manner. First, we design a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head) which offers a better balance between learning task-interactive and task-specific features, as well as a greater flexibility to learn the alignment via a task-aligned predictor. Second, we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL) to explicitly pull closer (or even unify) the optimal anchors for the two tasks during training via a designed sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS-COCO, where TOOD achieves a 51.1 AP at single-model single-scale testing. This surpasses the recent one-stage detectors by a large margin, such as ATSS [30] (47.7 AP), GFL [14] (48.2 AP), and PAA [9] (49.0 AP), with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Significant advances in object detection have been achieved through improved object representation and the use of deep neural network models. This paper examines more closely how object detection has evolved in the era of deep learning over the past years. We present a literature review on various state-of-the-art object detection algorithms and the underlying concepts behind these methods. We classify these methods into three main groups: anchor-based, anchor-free, and transformer-based detectors. Those approaches are distinct in the way they identify objects in the image. We discuss the insights behind these algorithms and experimental analyses to compare quality metrics, speed/accuracy tradeoffs, and training methodologies.

object detection,FCOS3D: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Monocular 3D object detection is an important task for autonomous driving considering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than conventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly reflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection offers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial to make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we study this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage detector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first transform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and decouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to different feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned only according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure. Furthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based on the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this framework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D correspondence priors.

object detection,Concealed Object Detection,"We present the first systematic study on concealed object detection (COD), which aims to identify objects that are visually embedded in their background. The high intrinsic similarities between the concealed objects and their background make COD far more challenging than traditional object detection/segmentation. To better understand this task, we collect a large-scale dataset, called COD10K, which consists of 10,000 images covering concealed objects in diverse real-world scenarios from 78 object categories. Further, we provide rich annotations including object categories, object boundaries, challenging attributes, object-level labels, and instance-level annotations. Our COD10K is the largest COD dataset to date, with the richest annotations, which enables comprehensive concealed object understanding and can even be used to help progress several other vision tasks, such as detection, segmentation, classification etc. Motivated by how animals hunt in the wild, we also design a simple but strong baseline for COD, termed the Search Identification Network (SINet).

object detection,Towards Open World Object Detection,"Humans have a natural instinct to identify unknown object instances in their environments. The intrinsic curiosity about these unknown instances aids in learning about them, when the corresponding knowledge is eventually available. This motivates us to propose a novel computer vision problem called: ‘Open World Object Detection’, where a model is tasked to: 1) identify objects that have not been introduced to it as ‘unknown’, without explicit supervision to do so, and 2) incrementally learn these identified unknown categories without forgetting previously learned classes, when the corresponding labels are progressively received. We formulate the problem, introduce a strong evaluation protocol and provide a novel solution, which we call ORE: Open World Object Detector, based on contrastive clustering and energy based unknown identification. Our experimental evaluation and ablation studies analyse the efficacy of ORE in achieving Open World objectives. As an interesting by-product, we find that identifying and characterising unknown instances helps to reduce confusion in an incremental object detection setting, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, with no extra methodological effort.

object detection,End-to-End Semi-Supervised Object Detection with Soft Teacher,"This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised object detection approach, in contrast to previous more complex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end training gradually improves pseudo label qualities during the curriculum, and the more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection training. We also propose two simple yet effective techniques within this framework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each unlabeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the teacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for the learning of box regression. On the COCO benchmark, the proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin under various labeling ratios, i.e. 1%, 5% and 10%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when the amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a 40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6 mAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leveraging the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev), it can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching 60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching 52.4 mAP.

object detection,FSCE: Few-Shot Object Detection via Contrastive Proposal Encoding,"Emerging interests have been brought to recognize previously unseen objects given very few training examples, known as few-shot object detection (FSOD). Recent researches demonstrate that good feature embedding is the key to reach favorable few-shot learning performance. We observe object proposals with different Intersection-of-Union (IoU) scores are analogous to the intra-image augmentation used in contrastive visual representation learning. And we exploit this analogy and incorporate supervised contrastive learning to achieve more robust objects representations in FSOD. We present Few-Shot object detection via Contrastive proposals Encoding (FSCE), a simple yet effective approach to learning contrastive-aware object proposal encodings that facilitate the classification of detected objects. We notice the degradation of average precision (AP) for rare objects mainly comes from misclassifying novel instances as confusable classes. And we ease the misclassification issues by promoting instance level intraclass compactness and inter-class variance via our contrastive proposal encoding loss (CPE loss). Our design outperforms current state-of-the-art works in any shot and all data splits, with up to +8.8% on standard benchmark PASCAL VOC and +2.7% on challenging COCO benchmark.

object detection,Improved YOLOv3 model with feature map cropping for multi-scale road object detection,"Road object detection is an essential and imperative step for driving intelligent vehicles. Generally, road objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians, present the characteristic of multi-scale and uncertain distribution which puts a high demand on the detection algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once v3)-based method aimed at enhancing the capability of cross-scale detection and focusing on the valuable area. The proposed method fills an urgent need for multi-scale detection, and its individual components will be useful in road object detection. The K-means-GIoU algorithm is designed to generate a priori boxes whose shapes are close to real boxes. This greatly reduces the complexity of training, paving the way for fast convergence. Then, a detection branch is added to detect small targets, and a feature map cropping module is introduced into the newly added detection branch to remove the areas with high probability of background targets and easy-to-detect targets, and the cropped areas of the feature map are filled with a value of 0. Further, a channel attention module and spatial attention module are added to strengthen the network’s attention to major regions. The experiment results on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method maintains a fast detection speed and increases the mAP (mean average precision) value by as much as 2.86 % compared with YOLOv3-ultralytics, and especially improves the detection performance for small-scale objects.","Lin-hong Shen, Hongfeng Tao, Yuanzhi Ni, Yue Wang, V.

object detection,ReDet: A Rotation-equivariant Detector for Aerial Object Detection,"Recently, object detection in aerial images has gained much attention in computer vision. Different from objects in natural images, aerial objects are often distributed with arbitrary orientation. Therefore, the detector requires more parameters to encode the orientation information, which are often highly redundant and inefficient. Moreover, as ordinary CNNs do not explicitly model the orientation variation, large amounts of rotation augmented data is needed to train an accurate object detector. In this paper, we propose a Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) to address these issues, which explicitly encodes rotation equivariance and rotation invariance. More precisely, we incorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract rotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and lead to a huge reduction of model size. Based on the rotation-equivariant features, we also present Rotation-invariant RoI Align (RiRoI Align), which adaptively extracts rotation-invariant features from equivariant features according to the orientation of RoI. Extensive experiments on several challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016, show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of aerial object detection. Compared with previous best results, our ReDet gains 1.2, 3.5 and 2.6 mAP on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 respectively while reducing the number of parameters by 60% (313 Mb vs. 121 Mb).

Compared to existing detection methods that employ a number of 3D-specific inductive biases, 3DETR requires minimal modifications to the vanilla Transformer block.

Nevertheless, 3DETR is conceptually simple and easy to implement, enabling further improvements by incorporating 3D domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we show 3DETR outperforms the well-established and highly optimized VoteNet baselines on the challenging ScanNetV2 dataset by 9.5%.

object detection,Libra R-CNN: Towards Balanced Learning for Object Detection,"Compared with model architectures, the training process, which is also crucial to the success of detectors, has received relatively less attention in object detection. In this work, we carefully revisit the standard training practice of detectors, and find that the detection performance is often limited by the imbalance during the training process, which generally consists in three levels - sample level, feature level, and objective level. To mitigate the adverse effects caused thereby, we propose Libra R-CNN, a simple but effective framework towards balanced learning for object detection. It integrates three novel components: IoU-balanced sampling, balanced feature pyramid, and balanced L1 loss, respectively for reducing the imbalance at sample, feature, and objective level. Benefitted from the overall balanced design, Libra R-CNN significantly improves the detection performance. Without bells and whistles, it achieves 2.5 points and 2.0 points higher Average Precision (AP) than FPN Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet respectively on MSCOCO.","Jiangmiao Pang, Kai Chen, Jianping Shi, H.

object detection,Rethinking Rotated Object Detection with Gaussian Wasserstein Distance Loss,"Boundary discontinuity and its inconsistency to the final detection metric have been the bottleneck for rotating detection regression loss design. In this paper, we propose a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance as a fundamental approach to solve the problem. Specifically, the rotated bounding box is converted to a 2-D Gaussian distribution, which enables to approximate the indifferentiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) which can be learned efficiently by gradient back-propagation. GWD can still be informative for learning even there is no overlapping between two rotating bounding boxes which is often the case for small object detection. Thanks to its three unique properties, GWD can also elegantly solve the boundary discontinuity and square-like problem regardless how the bounding box is defined. Experiments on five datasets using different detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.

object detection,Categorical Depth Distribution Network for Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Monocular 3D object detection is a key problem for autonomous vehicles, as it provides a solution with simple configuration compared to typical multi-sensor systems. The main challenge in monocular 3D detection lies in accurately predicting object depth, which must be inferred from object and scene cues due to the lack of direct range measurement. Many methods attempt to directly estimate depth to assist in 3D detection, but show limited performance as a result of depth inaccuracy. Our proposed solution, Categorical Depth Distribution Network (CaDDN), uses a predicted categorical depth distribution for each pixel to project rich contextual feature information to the appropriate depth interval in 3D space. We then use the computationally efficient bird’s-eye-view projection and single-stage detector to produce the final output detections. We design CaDDN as a fully differentiable end-to-end approach for joint depth estimation and object detection. We validate our approach on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, where we rank 1st among published monocular methods. We also provide the first monocular 3D detection results on the newly released Waymo Open Dataset.

object detection,Group-Free 3D Object Detection via Transformers,"Recently, directly detecting 3D objects from 3D point clouds has received increasing attention. To extract object representation from an irregular point cloud, existing methods usually take a point grouping step to assign the points to an object candidate so that a PointNet-like network could be used to derive object features from the grouped points. However, the inaccurate point assignments caused by the hand-crafted grouping scheme decrease the performance of 3D object detection.In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for directly detecting 3D objects from the 3D point cloud. Instead of grouping local points to each object candidate, our method computes the feature of an object from all the points in the point cloud with the help of an attention mechanism in the Transformers [42], where the contribution of each point is automatically learned in the network training. With an improved attention stacking scheme, our method fuses object features in different stages and generates more accurate object detection results.

Taking the perspective that horizontal detection is a special case for rotated object detection, in this paper, we are motivated to change the design of rotation regression loss from induction paradigm to deduction methodology, in terms of the relation between rotation and horizontal detection. We show that one essential challenge is how to modulate the coupled parameters in the rotation regression loss, as such the estimated parameters can influence to each other during the dynamic joint optimization, in an adaptive and synergetic way. Specifically, we first convert the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution, and then calculate the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian distributions as the regression loss. By analyzing the gradient of each parameter, we show that KLD (and its derivatives) can dynamically adjust the parameter gradients according to the characteristics of the object. It will adjust the importance (gradient weight) of the angle parameter according to the aspect ratio. This mechanism can be vital for high-precision detection as a slight angle error would cause a serious accuracy drop for large aspect ratios objects. More importantly, we have proved that KLD is scale invariant. We further show that the KLD loss can be degenerated into the popular $l_{n}$-norm loss for horizontal detection.

object detection,Voxel Transformer for 3D Object Detection,"We present Voxel Transformer (VoTr), a novel and effective voxel-based Transformer backbone for 3D object detection from point clouds. Conventional 3D convolutional backbones in voxel-based 3D detectors cannot efficiently capture large context information, which is crucial for object recognition and localization, owing to the limited receptive fields. In this paper, we resolve the problem by introducing a Transformer-based architecture that enables long-range relationships between voxels by self-attention. Given the fact that non-empty voxels are naturally sparse but numerous, directly applying standard Transformer on voxels is non-trivial. To this end, we propose the sparse voxel module and the submanifold voxel module, which can operate on the empty and non-empty voxel positions effectively. To further enlarge the attention range while maintaining comparable computational overhead to the convolutional counterparts, we propose two attention mechanisms for multi-head attention in those two modules: Local Attention and Dilated Attention, and we further propose Fast Voxel Query to accelerate the querying process in multi-head attention. VoTr contains a series of sparse and submanifold voxel modules, and can be applied in most voxel-based detectors. Our proposed VoTr shows consistent improvement over the convolutional baselines while maintaining computational efficiency on the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset.","Jiageng Mao, Yujing Xue, Minzhe Niu, Haoyue Bai, Jiashi Feng, Xiaodan Liang, Hang Xu, Chunjing Xu",2021.0,447,IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/813b03e123d448d53d93a087a2d34a04dfe70c5c,0.9759999999999991,0.0036323744514870798,object detection voxel transformer for 3d object detection we present voxel transformer votr a novel and effective voxelbased transformer backbone for 3d object detection from point clouds conventional 3d convolutional backbones in voxelbased 3d detectors cannot efficiently capture large context information which is crucial for object recognition and localization owing to the limited receptive fields in this paper we resolve the problem by introducing a transformerbased architecture that enables longrange relationships between voxels by selfattention given the fact that nonempty voxels are naturally sparse but numerous directly applying standard transformer on voxels is nontrivial to this end we propose the sparse voxel module and the submanifold voxel module which can operate on the empty and nonempty voxel positions effectively to further enlarge the attention range while maintaining comparable computational overhead to the convolutional counterparts we propose two attention mechanisms for multihead attention in those two modules local attention and dilated attention and we further propose fast voxel query to accelerate the querying process in multihead attention votr contains a series of sparse and submanifold voxel modules and can be applied in most voxelbased detectors our proposed votr shows consistent improvement over the convolutional baselines while maintaining computational efficiency on the kitti dataset and the waymo open dataset jiageng mao yujing xue minzhe niu haoyue bai jiashi feng xiaodan liang hang xu chunjing xu
object detection,Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN for Object Detection in the Wild,"Object detection typically assumes that training and test data are drawn from an identical distribution, which, however, does not always hold in practice. Such a distribution mismatch will lead to a significant performance drop. In this work, we aim to improve the cross-domain robustness of object detection. We tackle the domain shift on two levels: 1) the image-level shift, such as image style, illumination, etc., and 2) the instance-level shift, such as object appearance, size, etc. We build our approach based on the recent state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN model, and design two domain adaptation components, on image level and instance level, to reduce the domain discrepancy. The two domain adaptation components are based on $$-divergence theory, and are implemented by learning a domain classifier in adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers on different levels are further reinforced with a consistency regularization to learn a domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model. We evaluate our newly proposed approach using multiple datasets including Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K, etc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for robust object detection in various domain shift scenarios.","Yuhua Chen, Wen Li, Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, L.

object detection,Frustratingly Simple Few-Shot Object Detection,"Detecting rare objects from a few examples is an emerging problem. Prior works show meta-learning is a promising approach. But, fine-tuning techniques have drawn scant attention. We find that fine-tuning only the last layer of existing detectors on rare classes is crucial to the few-shot object detection task. Such a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by roughly 2~20 points on current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods. However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based on three datasets: PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS.

object detection,Image-Adaptive YOLO for Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions,"Though deep learning-based object detection methods have achieved promising results on the conventional datasets, it is still challenging to locate objects from the low-quality images captured in adverse weather conditions. The existing methods either have difficulties in balancing the tasks of image enhancement and object detection, or often ignore the latent information beneficial for detection. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Image-Adaptive YOLO (IA-YOLO) framework, where each image can be adaptively enhanced for better detection performance. Specifically, a differentiable image processing (DIP) module is presented to take into account the adverse weather conditions for YOLO detector, whose parameters are predicted by a small convolutional neural network (CNN-PP). We learn CNN-PP and YOLOv3 jointly in an end-to-end fashion, which ensures that CNN-PP can learn an appropriate DIP to enhance the image for detection in a weakly supervised manner. Our proposed IA-YOLO approach can adaptively process images in both normal and adverse weather conditions.

object detection,PointAugmenting: Cross-Modal Augmentation for 3D Object Detection,"Camera and LiDAR are two complementary sensors for 3D object detection in the autonomous driving context. Camera provides rich texture and color cues while LiDAR specializes in relative distance sensing. The challenge of 3D object detection lies in effectively fusing 2D camera images with 3D LiDAR points. In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal 3D object detection algorithm, named PointAugmenting. On one hand, PointAugmenting decorates point clouds with corresponding point-wise CNN features extracted by pretrained 2D detection models, and then performs 3D object detection over the decorated point clouds. In comparison with highly abstract semantic segmentation scores to decorate point clouds, CNN features from detection networks adapt to object appearance variations, achieving significant improvement. On the other hand, PointAugmenting benefits from a novel cross-modal data augmentation algorithm, which consistently pastes virtual objects into images and point clouds during network training. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our PointAugmenting. Notably, PointAugmenting outperforms the LiDAR-only baseline detector by +6.5% mAP and achieves the new state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes leaderboard to date.","Chunwei Wang, Chao Ma, Ming Zhu, Xiaokang Yang",2021.0,384,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/747a2bbe3765f488eedac33a2ac7a0069020da57,0.9759999999999991,0.0031204290589956123,object detection pointaugmenting crossmodal augmentation for 3d object detection camera and lidar are two complementary sensors for 3d object detection in the autonomous driving context camera provides rich texture and color cues while lidar specializes in relative distance sensing the challenge of 3d object detection lies in effectively fusing 2d camera images with 3d lidar points in this paper we present a novel crossmodal 3d object detection algorithm named pointaugmenting on one hand pointaugmenting decorates point clouds with corresponding pointwise cnn features extracted by pretrained 2d detection models and then performs 3d object detection over the decorated point clouds in comparison with highly abstract semantic segmentation scores to decorate point clouds cnn features from detection networks adapt to object appearance variations achieving significant improvement on the other hand pointaugmenting benefits from a novel crossmodal data augmentation algorithm which consistently pastes virtual objects into images and point clouds during network training extensive experiments on the largescale nuscenes and waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our pointaugmenting notably pointaugmenting outperforms the lidaronly baseline detector by 65 map and achieves the new stateoftheart results on the nuscenes leaderboard to date chunwei wang chao ma ming zhu xiaokang yang
object detection,PV-RCNN++: Point-Voxel Feature Set Abstraction With Local Vector Representation for 3D Object Detection,"3D object detection is receiving increasing attention from both industry and academia thanks to its wide applications in various fields. In this paper, we propose Point-Voxel Region-based Convolution Neural Networks (PV-RCNNs) for 3D object detection on point clouds. First, we propose a novel 3D detector, PV-RCNN, which boosts the 3D detection performance by deeply integrating the feature learning of both point-based set abstraction and voxel-based sparse convolution through two novel steps, i.e. , the voxel-to-keypoint scene encoding and the keypoint-to-grid RoI feature abstraction. Second, we propose an advanced framework, PV-RCNN++, for more efficient and accurate 3D object detection. It consists of two major improvements: sectorized proposal-centric sampling for efficiently producing more representative keypoints, and VectorPool aggregation for better aggregating local point features with much less resource consumption. With these two strategies, our PV-RCNN++ is about $$3\times $$ 3 × faster than PV-RCNN, while also achieving better performance. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed PV-RCNN++ framework achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance on the large-scale and highly-competitive Waymo Open Dataset with 10 FPS inference speed on the detection range of $$150m \times 150m$$ 150 m × 150 m .","Shaoshuai Shi, Li Jiang, Jiajun Deng, Zhe Wang, Chaoxu Guo, Jianping Shi, Xiaogang Wang, Hongsheng Li",2021.0,476,International Journal of Computer Vision,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c3fe084caa8fd3798c1ae1a48909b9eb2d4dc5f,0.9759999999999991,0.0038680318543799774,object detection pvrcnn pointvoxel feature set abstraction with local vector representation for 3d object detection 3d object detection is receiving increasing attention from both industry and academia thanks to its wide applications in various fields in this paper we propose pointvoxel regionbased convolution neural networks pvrcnns for 3d object detection on point clouds first we propose a novel 3d detector pvrcnn which boosts the 3d detection performance by deeply integrating the feature learning of both pointbased set abstraction and voxelbased sparse convolution through two novel steps ie the voxeltokeypoint scene encoding and the keypointtogrid roi feature abstraction second we propose an advanced framework pvrcnn for more efficient and accurate 3d object detection it consists of two major improvements sectorized proposalcentric sampling for efficiently producing more representative keypoints and vectorpool aggregation for better aggregating local point features with much less resource consumption with these two strategies our pvrcnn is about 3times 3 faster than pvrcnn while also achieving better performance the experiments demonstrate that our proposed pvrcnn framework achieves stateoftheart 3d detection performance on the largescale and highlycompetitive waymo open dataset with 10 fps inference speed on the detection range of 150m times 150m 150 m 150 m shaoshuai shi li jiang jiajun deng zhe wang chaoxu guo jianping shi xiaogang wang hongsheng li
object detection,Anchor-Free Oriented Proposal Generator for Object Detection,"Oriented object detection is a practical and challenging task in remote sensing image interpretation. Nowadays, oriented detectors mostly use horizontal boxes as intermedium to derive oriented boxes from them. However, the horizontal boxes are inclined to get small Intersection-over-Unions (IoUs) with ground truths, which may have some undesirable effects, such as introducing redundant noise, mismatching with ground truths, and detracting from the robustness of detectors. In this article, we propose a novel anchor-free oriented proposal generator (AOPG) that abandons horizontal box-related operations from the network architecture. AOPG first produces coarse oriented boxes by a coarse location module (CLM) in an anchor-free manner and then refines them into high-quality oriented proposals. After AOPG, we apply a Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) head to produce the final detection results. Furthermore, the shortage of large-scale datasets is also a hindrance to the development of oriented object detection. To alleviate the data insufficiency, we release a new dataset on the basis of our DIOR dataset and name it DIOR-R. Massive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AOPG. Particularly, without bells and whistles, we achieve the accuracy of 64.41%, 75.24%, and 96.22% mAP on the DIOR-R, DOTA, and HRSC2016 datasets, respectively.

object detection,Camouflaged Object Detection,"We present a comprehensive study on a new task named camouflaged object detection (COD), which aims to identify objects that are “seamlessly” embedded in their surroundings. The high intrinsic similarities between the target object and the background make COD far more challenging than the traditional object detection task. To address this issue, we elaborately collect a novel dataset, called COD10K, which comprises 10,000 images covering camouflaged objects in various natural scenes, over 78 object categories. All the images are densely annotated with category, bounding-box, object-/instance-level, and matting-level labels.

object detection,Voxel R-CNN: Towards High Performance Voxel-based 3D Object Detection,"Recent advances on 3D object detection heavily rely on how the 3D data are represented, i.e., voxel-based or point-based representation. Many existing high performance 3D detectors are point-based because this structure can better retain precise point positions. Nevertheless, point-level features lead to high computation overheads due to unordered storage. In contrast, the voxel-based structure is better suited for feature extraction but often yields lower accuracy because the input data are divided into grids. In this paper, we take a slightly different viewpoint --- we find that precise positioning of raw points is not essential for high performance 3D object detection and that the coarse voxel granularity can also offer sufficient detection accuracy. Bearing this view in mind, we devise a simple but effective voxel-based framework, named Voxel R-CNN. By taking full advantage of voxel features in a two-stage approach, our method achieves comparable detection accuracy with state-of-the-art point-based models, but at a fraction of the computation cost. Voxel R-CNN consists of a 3D backbone network, a 2D bird-eye-view (BEV) Region Proposal Network, and a detect head. A voxel RoI pooling is devised to extract RoI features directly from voxel features for further refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used KITTI Dataset and the more recent Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that compared to existing voxel-based methods, Voxel R-CNN delivers a higher detection accuracy while maintaining a real-time frame processing rate, i.e., at a speed of 25 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

object detection,HYDRO-3D: Hybrid Object Detection and Tracking for Cooperative Perception Using 3D LiDAR,"3D-LiDAR-based cooperative perception has been generating significant interest for its ability to tackle challenges such as occlusion, sparse point clouds, and out-of-range issues that can be problematic for single-vehicle perception. Despite its effectiveness in overcoming various challenges, cooperative perception's performance can still be affected by the aforementioned issues when Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) operate at the edges of their sensing range. Our proposed approach called HYDRO-3D aims to improve object detection performance by explicitly incorporating historical object tracking information. Specifically, HYDRO-3D combines object detection features from a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm (V2X-ViT) with historical information from the object tracking algorithm to infer objects. Afterward, a novel spatial-temporal 3D neural network performing global and local manipulations of object-tracking historical data is applied to generate the feature map to enhance object detection. The proposed HYDRO-3D method is comprehensively evaluated on the state-of-the-art V2XSet. The qualitative and quantitative experiment results demonstrate that the HYDRO-3D can effectively utilize the object tracking information and achieve robust object detection performance. It outperforms the SOTA V2X-ViT by 3.7% in AP@0.7 of object detection for CAVs and can also be generalized to single-vehicle object detection with 4.5% improvement in AP@0.7.","Zonglin Meng, Xin Xia, Runsheng Xu, W.

object detection,Objects are Different: Flexible Monocular 3D Object Detection,"The precise localization of 3D objects from a single image without depth information is a highly challenging problem. Most existing methods adopt the same approach for all objects regardless of their diverse distributions, leading to limited performance for truncated objects. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for monocular 3D object detection which explicitly decouples the truncated objects and adaptively combines multiple approaches for object depth estimation. Specifically, we decouple the edge of the feature map for predicting long-tail truncated objects so that the optimization of normal objects is not influenced.

object detection,Soft-NMS — Improving Object Detection with One Line of Code,"Non-maximum suppression is an integral part of the object detection pipeline. First, it sorts all detection boxes on the basis of their scores. The detection box M with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a significant overlap (using a pre-defined threshold) with M are suppressed. This process is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the algorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leads to a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-NMS, an algorithm which decays the detection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap with M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-NMS obtains consistent improvements for the coco-style mAP metric on standard datasets like PASCAL VOC2007 (1.7% for both R-FCN and Faster-RCNN) and MS-COCO (1.3% for R-FCN and 1.1% for Faster-RCNN) by just changing the NMS algorithm without any additional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-RFCN, Soft-NMS improves state-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8% to 40.9% with a single model. Further, the computational complexity of Soft-NMS is the same as traditional NMS and hence it can be efficiently implemented. Since Soft-NMS does not require any extra training and is simple to implement, it can be easily integrated into any object detection pipeline.

object detection,Unifying Voxel-based Representation with Transformer for 3D Object Detection,"In this work, we present a unified framework for multi-modality 3D object detection, named UVTR. The proposed method aims to unify multi-modality representations in the voxel space for accurate and robust single- or cross-modality 3D detection. To this end, the modality-specific space is first designed to represent different inputs in the voxel feature space. Different from previous work, our approach preserves the voxel space without height compression to alleviate semantic ambiguity and enable spatial connections. To make full use of the inputs from different sensors, the cross-modality interaction is then proposed, including knowledge transfer and modality fusion. In this way, geometry-aware expressions in point clouds and context-rich features in images are well utilized for better performance and robustness. The transformer decoder is applied to efficiently sample features from the unified space with learnable positions, which facilitates object-level interactions. In general, UVTR presents an early attempt to represent different modalities in a unified framework. It surpasses previous work in single- or multi-modality entries.

object detection,Slicing Aided Hyper Inference and Fine-Tuning for Small Object Detection,"Detection of small objects and objects far away in the scene is a major challenge in surveillance applications. Such objects are represented by small number of pixels in the image and lack sufficient details, making them difficult to detect using conventional detectors. In this work, an open-source framework called Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) is proposed that provides a generic slicing aided inference and fine-tuning pipeline for small object detection. The proposed technique is generic in the sense that it can be applied on top of any available object detector without any fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations, using object detection baselines on the Visdrone and xView aerial object detection datasets show that the proposed inference method can increase object detection AP by 6.8%, 5.1% and 5.3% for FCOS, VFNet and TOOD detectors, respectively. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further increased with a slicing aided fine-tuning, resulting in a cumulative increase of 12.7%, 13.4% and 14.5% AP in the same order.

object detection,BASNet: Boundary-Aware Salient Object Detection,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been adopted for salient object detection and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Most of the previous works however focus on region accuracy but not on the boundary quality. In this paper, we propose a predict-refine architecture, BASNet, and a new hybrid loss for Boundary-Aware Salient object detection. Specifically, the architecture is composed of a densely supervised Encoder-Decoder network and a residual refinement module, which are respectively in charge of saliency prediction and saliency map refinement. The hybrid loss guides the network to learn the transformation between the input image and the ground truth in a three-level hierarchy -- pixel-, patch- and map- level -- by fusing Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) losses. Equipped with the hybrid loss, the proposed predict-refine architecture is able to effectively segment the salient object regions and accurately predict the fine structures with clear boundaries. Experimental results on six public datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in terms of regional and boundary evaluation measures.

object detection,ByteTrack: Multi-Object Tracking by Associating Every Detection Box,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims at estimating bounding boxes and identities of objects in videos. Most methods obtain identities by associating detection boxes whose scores are higher than a threshold. The objects with low detection scores, e.g. occluded objects, are simply thrown away, which brings non-negligible true object missing and fragmented trajectories. To solve this problem, we present a simple, effective and generic association method, tracking by associating almost every detection box instead of only the high score ones. For the low score detection boxes, we utilize their similarities with tracklets to recover true objects and filter out the background detections. When applied to 9 different state-of-the-art trackers, our method achieves consistent improvement on IDF1 score ranging from 1 to 10 points. To put forwards the state-of-the-art performance of MOT, we design a simple and strong tracker, named ByteTrack. For the first time, we achieve 80.3 MOTA, 77.3 IDF1 and 63.1 HOTA on the test set of MOT17 with 30 FPS running speed on a single V100 GPU.

object detection,UIU-Net: U-Net in U-Net for Infrared Small Object Detection,"Learning-based infrared small object detection methods currently rely heavily on the classification backbone network. This tends to result in tiny object loss and feature distinguishability limitations as the network depth increases. Furthermore, small objects in infrared images are frequently emerged bright and dark, posing severe demands for obtaining precise object contrast information. For this reason, we in this paper propose a simple and effective “U-Net in U-Net” framework, UIU-Net for short, and detect small objects in infrared images. As the name suggests, UIU-Net embeds a tiny U-Net into a larger U-Net backbone, enabling the multi-level and multi-scale representation learning of objects. Moreover, UIU-Net can be trained from scratch, and the learned features can enhance global and local contrast information effectively. More specifically, the UIU-Net model is divided into two modules: the resolution-maintenance deep supervision (RM-DS) module and the interactive-cross attention (IC-A) module. RM-DS integrates Residual U-blocks into a deep supervision network to generate deep multi-scale resolution-maintenance features while learning global context information. Further, IC-A encodes the local context information between the low-level details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments conducted on two infrared single-frame image datasets, i.e., SIRST and Synthetic datasets, show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UIU-Net in comparison with several state-of-the-art infrared small object detection methods. The proposed UIU-Net also produces powerful generalization performance for video sequence infrared small object datasets, e.g., ATR ground/air video sequence dataset.

object detection,A Survey on Performance Metrics for Object-Detection Algorithms,"This work explores and compares the plethora of metrics for the performance evaluation of object-detection algorithms. Average precision (AP),for instance, is a popular metric for evaluating the accuracy of object detectors by estimating the area under the curve (AUC) of the precision × recall relationship. Depending on the point interpolation used in the plot, two different AP variants can be defined and, therefore, different results are generated. AP has six additional variants increasing the possibilities of benchmarking. The lack of consensus in different works and AP implementations is a problem faced by the academic and scientific communities. Metric implementations written in different computational languages and platforms are usually distributed with corresponding datasets sharing a given bounding-box description. Such projects indeed help the community with evaluation tools, but demand extra work to be adapted for other datasets and bounding-box formats.

object detection,DeepFusion: Lidar-Camera Deep Fusion for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection,"Lidars and cameras are critical sensors that provide complementary information for 3D detection in autonomous driving. While prevalent multi-modal methods [34], [36] simply decorate raw lidar point clouds with camera features and feed them directly to existing 3D detection models, our study shows that fusing camera features with deep lidar features instead of raw points, can lead to better performance. However, as those features are often augmented and aggregated, a key challenge in fusion is how to effectively align the transformed features from two modalities. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques: InverseAug that inverses geometric-related augmentations, e.g., rotation, to enable accurate geometric alignment between lidar points and image pixels, and LearnableAlign that leverages cross-attention to dynamically capture the correlations between image and lidar features during fusion. Based on InverseAug and LearnableAlign, we develop a family of generic multi-modal 3D detection models named DeepFusion, which is more accurate than previous methods. For example, DeepFusion improves Point-Pillars, CenterPoint, and 3D-MAN baselines on Pedestrian detection for 6.7,8.9, and 6.2 LEVEL_2 APH, respectively.

object detection,Enhancing Geometric Factors in Model Learning and Inference for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation,"Deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation have achieved unprecedented progress. In this article, we propose complete-IoU (CIoU) loss and Cluster-NMS for enhancing geometric factors in both bounding-box regression and nonmaximum suppression (NMS), leading to notable gains of average precision (AP) and average recall (AR), without the sacrifice of inference efficiency. In particular, we consider three geometric factors, that is: 1) overlap area; 2) normalized central-point distance; and 3) aspect ratio, which are crucial for measuring bounding-box regression in object detection and instance segmentation. The three geometric factors are then incorporated into CIoU loss for better distinguishing difficult regression cases. The training of deep models using CIoU loss results in consistent AP and AR improvements in comparison to widely adopted $\ell _{n}$ -norm loss and IoU-based loss. Furthermore, we propose Cluster-NMS, where NMS during inference is done by implicitly clustering detected boxes and usually requires fewer iterations. Cluster-NMS is very efficient due to its pure GPU implementation, and geometric factors can be incorporated to improve both AP and AR. In the experiments, CIoU loss and Cluster-NMS have been applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g., YOLACT and BlendMask-RT), and object detection (e.g., YOLO v3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) models.

object detection,"Object detection using YOLO: challenges, architectural successors, datasets and applications","Object detection is one of the predominant and challenging problems in computer vision. Over the decade, with the expeditious evolution of deep learning, researchers have extensively experimented and contributed in the performance enhancement of object detection and related tasks such as object classification, localization, and segmentation using underlying deep models. Broadly, object detectors are classified into two categories viz. two stage and single stage object detectors. Two stage detectors mainly focus on selective region proposals strategy via complex architecture; however, single stage detectors focus on all the spatial region proposals for the possible detection of objects via relatively simpler architecture in one shot. Performance of any object detector is evaluated through detection accuracy and inference time. Generally, the detection accuracy of two stage detectors outperforms single stage object detectors. However, the inference time of single stage detectors is better compared to its counterparts. Moreover, with the advent of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and its architectural successors, the detection accuracy is improving significantly and sometime it is better than two stage detectors. YOLOs are adopted in various applications majorly due to their faster inferences rather than considering detection accuracy. As an example, detection accuracies are 63.4 and 70 for YOLO and Fast-RCNN respectively, however, inference time is around 300 times faster in case of YOLO. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of single stage object detectors specially YOLOs, regression formulation, their architecture advancements, and performance statistics. Moreover, we summarize the comparative illustration between two stage and single stage object detectors, among different versions of YOLOs, applications based on two stage detectors, and different versions of YOLOs along with the future research directions.","Tausif Diwan, G.

object detection,Cross-Domain Adaptive Teacher for Object Detection,"We address the task of domain adaptation in object detection, where there is an obvious domain gap between a domain with annotations (source) and a domain of interest without annotations (target). As a popular semi-supervised learning method, the teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has also yielded a large accuracy gain in cross-domain object detection. However, it suffers from the domain shift and generates many low-quality pseudo labels (e.g., false positives), which leads to sub-optimal performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a teacher-student framework named Adaptive Teacher (AT) which leverages domain adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to address the domain gap. Specifically, we employ feature-level adversarial training in the student model, allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share similar distributions. This process ensures the student model produces domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher model (taking data from the target domain) and the student model (taking data from both domains). This enables the teacher model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the source domain. We show that AT demonstrates superiority over existing approaches and even Oracle (fully-supervised) models by a large margin. For example, we achieve 50.9% (49.3%) mAP on Foggy Cityscape (Cli-part1K), which is 9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous state-of-the-art and Oracle, respectively.","Yu-Jhe Li, Xiaoliang Dai, Chih-Yao Ma, Yen-Cheng Liu, Kan Chen, Bichen Wu, Zijian He, Kris Kitani, Péter Vajda",2021.0,220,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/612b0d298088e1604589834a626b200165a989f5,0.9759999999999991,0.0017877458150495694,object detection crossdomain adaptive teacher for object detection we address the task of domain adaptation in object detection where there is an obvious domain gap between a domain with annotations source and a domain of interest without annotations target as a popular semisupervised learning method the teacherstudent framework a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model has also yielded a large accuracy gain in crossdomain object detection however it suffers from the domain shift and generates many lowquality pseudo labels eg false positives which leads to suboptimal performance to mitigate this problem we propose a teacherstudent framework named adaptive teacher at which leverages domain adversarial learning and weakstrong data augmentation to address the domain gap specifically we employ featurelevel adversarial training in the student model allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share similar distributions this process ensures the student model produces domaininvariant features furthermore we apply weakstrong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher model taking data from the target domain and the student model taking data from both domains this enables the teacher model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the source domain we show that at demonstrates superiority over existing approaches and even oracle fullysupervised models by a large margin for example we achieve 509 493 map on foggy cityscape clipart1k which is 92 52 and 82 110 higher than previous stateoftheart and oracle respectively yujhe li xiaoliang dai chihyao ma yencheng liu kan chen bichen wu zijian he kris kitani péter vajda

object detection,Multi-Scale Interactive Network for Salient Object Detection,"Deep-learning based salient object detection methods achieve great progress. However, the variable scale and unknown category of salient objects are great challenges all the time. These are closely related to the utilization of multi-level and multi-scale features. In this paper, we propose the aggregate interaction modules to integrate the features from adjacent levels, in which less noise is introduced because of only using small up-/down-sampling rates. To obtain more efficient multi-scale features from the integrated features, the self-interaction modules are embedded in each decoder unit. Besides, the class imbalance issue caused by the scale variation weakens the effect of the binary cross entropy loss and results in the spatial inconsistency of the predictions. Therefore, we exploit the consistency-enhanced loss to highlight the fore-/back-ground difference and preserve the intra-class consistency.

object detection,Open-Vocabulary Object Detection Using Captions,"Despite the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in object detection, they are costly to train and scale due to supervision requirements. Particularly, learning more object categories typically requires proportionally more bounding box annotations. Weakly supervised and zero-shot learning techniques have been explored to scale object detectors to more categories with less supervision, but they have not been as successful and widely adopted as supervised models. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary object detection, which is more general, more practical, and more effective than weakly supervised and zero-shot approaches. We propose a new method to train object detectors using bounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories, as well as image-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly lower cost. We show that the proposed method can detect and localize objects for which no bounding box annotation is provided during training, at a significantly higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches. Meanwhile, objects with bounding box annotation can be detected almost as accurately as supervised methods, which is significantly better than weakly supervised baselines.

object detection,Oriented RepPoints for Aerial Object Detection,"In contrast to the generic object, aerial targets are often non-axis aligned with arbitrary orientations having the cluttered surroundings. Unlike the mainstreamed approaches regressing the bounding box orientations, this paper proposes an effective adaptive points learning approach to aerial object detection by taking advantage of the adaptive points representation, which is able to capture the geometric information of the arbitrary-oriented instances. To this end, three oriented conversion functions are presented to facilitate the classification and localization with accurate orientation. Moreover, we propose an effective quality assessment and sample assignment scheme for adaptive points learning toward choosing the representative oriented reppoints samples during training, which is able to capture the non-axis aligned features from adjacent objects or background noises.

Concretely, we define the unit transportation cost between each demander (anchor) and supplier (gt) pair as the weighted summation of their classification and regression losses. After formulation, finding the best assignment solution is converted to solve the optimal transport plan at minimal transportation costs, which can be solved via Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration.

object detection,A Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance for Tiny Object Detection,"Detecting tiny objects is a very challenging problem since a tiny object only contains a few pixels in size. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors do not produce satisfactory results on tiny objects due to the lack of appearance information. Our key observation is that Intersection over Union (IoU) based metrics such as IoU itself and its extensions are very sensitive to the location deviation of the tiny objects, and drastically deteriorate the detection performance when used in anchor-based detectors. To alleviate this, we propose a new evaluation metric using Wasserstein distance for tiny object detection. Specifically, we first model the bounding boxes as 2D Gaussian distributions and then propose a new metric dubbed Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to compute the similarity between them by their corresponding Gaussian distributions. The proposed NWD metric can be easily embedded into the assignment, non-maximum suppression, and loss function of any anchor-based detector to replace the commonly used IoU metric. We evaluate our metric on a new dataset for tiny object detection (AI-TOD) in which the average object size is much smaller than existing object detection datasets. Extensive experiments show that, when equipped with NWD metric, our approach yields performance that is 6.7 AP points higher than a standard fine-tuning baseline, and 6.0 AP points higher than state-of-the-art competitors.

object detection,Is Pseudo-Lidar needed for Monocular 3D Object detection?,"Recent progress in 3D object detection from single images leverages monocular depth estimation as a way to produce 3D pointclouds, turning cameras into pseudo-lidar sensors. These two-stage detectors improve with the accuracy of the intermediate depth estimation network, which can itself be improved without manual labels via large-scale self-supervised learning. However, they tend to suffer from overfitting more than end-to-end methods, are more complex, and the gap with similar lidar-based detectors remains significant. In this work, we propose an end-to-end, single stage, monocular 3D object detector, DD3D, that can benefit from depth pre-training like pseudo-lidar methods, but without their limitations. Our architecture is designed for effective information transfer between depth estimation and 3D detection, allowing us to scale with the amount of unlabeled pre-training data.

object detection,Salient Object Detection via Integrity Learning,"Although current salient object detection (SOD) works have achieved significant progress, they are limited when it comes to the integrity of the predicted salient regions. We define the concept of integrity at both a micro and macro level. Specifically, at the micro level, the model should highlight all parts that belong to a certain salient object. Meanwhile, at the macro level, the model needs to discover all salient objects in a given image. To facilitate integrity learning for SOD, we design a novel <bold>I</bold>ntegrity <bold>Co</bold>gnition <bold>N</bold>etwork (<italic>ICON</italic>), which explores three important components for learning strong integrity features. 1) Unlike existing models, which focus more on feature discriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation (DFA) component to aggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e., kernel shape and context) and increase feature diversity. Such diversity is the foundation for mining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA features, we introduce an integrity channel enhancement (ICE) component with the goal of enhancing feature channels that highlight the integral salient objects, while suppressing the other distracting ones. 3) After extracting the enhanced features, the part-whole verification (PWV) method is employed to determine whether the part and whole object features have strong agreement. Such part-whole agreements can further improve the micro-level integrity for each salient object.

object detection,Structure Aware Single-Stage 3D Object Detection From Point Cloud,"3D object detection from point cloud data plays an essential role in autonomous driving. Current single-stage detectors are efficient by progressively downscaling the 3D point clouds in a fully convolutional manner. However, the downscaled features inevitably lose spatial information and cannot make full use of the structure information of 3D point cloud, degrading their localization precision. In this work, we propose to improve the localization precision of single-stage detectors by explicitly leveraging the structure information of 3D point cloud. Specifically, we design an auxiliary network which converts the convolutional features in the backbone network back to point-level representations. The auxiliary network is jointly optimized, by two point-level supervisions, to guide the convolutional features in the backbone network to be aware of the object structure. The auxiliary network can be detached after training and therefore introduces no extra computation in the inference stage. Besides, considering that single-stage detectors suffer from the discordance between the predicted bounding boxes and corresponding classification confidences, we develop an efficient part-sensitive warping operation to align the confidences to the predicted bounding boxes. Our proposed detector ranks at the top of KITTI 3D/BEV detection leaderboards and runs at 25 FPS for inference.","Chenhang He, Huiyu Zeng, Jianqiang Huang, Xiansheng Hua, Lei Zhang",2020.0,540,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6ca0f76ef6b69a3c1ef63251c78116af34626b4,0.968,0.004388103364212579,object detection structure aware singlestage 3d object detection from point cloud 3d object detection from point cloud data plays an essential role in autonomous driving current singlestage detectors are efficient by progressively downscaling the 3d point clouds in a fully convolutional manner however the downscaled features inevitably lose spatial information and cannot make full use of the structure information of 3d point cloud degrading their localization precision in this work we propose to improve the localization precision of singlestage detectors by explicitly leveraging the structure information of 3d point cloud specifically we design an auxiliary network which converts the convolutional features in the backbone network back to pointlevel representations the auxiliary network is jointly optimized by two pointlevel supervisions to guide the convolutional features in the backbone network to be aware of the object structure the auxiliary network can be detached after training and therefore introduces no extra computation in the inference stage besides considering that singlestage detectors suffer from the discordance between the predicted bounding boxes and corresponding classification confidences we develop an efficient partsensitive warping operation to align the confidences to the predicted bounding boxes our proposed detector ranks at the top of kitti 3dbev detection leaderboards and runs at 25 fps for inference chenhang he huiyu zeng jianqiang huang xiansheng hua lei zhang
object detection,Global Context-Aware Progressive Aggregation Network for Salient Object Detection,"Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved competitive performance in salient object detection, in which how to learn effective and comprehensive features plays a critical role. Most of the previous works mainly adopted multiple-level feature integration yet ignored the gap between different features. Besides, there also exists a dilution process of high-level features as they passed on the top-down pathway. To remedy these issues, we propose a novel network named GCPANet to effectively integrate low-level appearance features, high-level semantic features, and global context features through some progressive context-aware Feature Interweaved Aggregation (FIA) modules and generate the saliency map in a supervised way. Moreover, a Head Attention (HA) module is used to reduce information redundancy and enhance the top layers features by leveraging the spatial and channel-wise attention, and the Self Refinement (SR) module is utilized to further refine and heighten the input features. Furthermore, we design the Global Context Flow (GCF) module to generate the global context information at different stages, which aims to learn the relationship among different salient regions and alleviate the dilution effect of high-level features.

object detection,Suppress and Balance: A Simple Gated Network for Salient Object Detection,"Most salient object detection approaches use U-Net or feature pyramid networks (FPN) as their basic structures. These methods ignore two key problems when the encoder exchanges information with the decoder: one is the lack of interference control between them, the other is without considering the disparity of the contributions of different encoder blocks. In this work, we propose a simple gated network (GateNet) to solve both issues at once. With the help of multilevel gate units, the valuable context information from the encoder can be optimally transmitted to the decoder. We design a novel gated dual branch structure to build the cooperation among different levels of features and improve the discriminability of the whole network. Through the dual branch design, more details of the saliency map can be further restored. In addition, we adopt the atrous spatial pyramid pooling based on the proposed ""Fold"" operation (Fold-ASPP) to accurately localize salient objects of various scales.

object detection,Probabilistic Anchor Assignment with IoU Prediction for Object Detection,"In object detection, determining which anchors to assign as positive or negative samples, known as anchor assignment, has been revealed as a core procedure that can significantly affect a model's performance. In this paper we propose a novel anchor assignment strategy that adaptively separates anchors into positive and negative samples for a ground truth bounding box according to the model's learning status such that it is able to reason about the separation in a probabilistic manner. To do so we first calculate the scores of anchors conditioned on the model and fit a probability distribution to these scores. The model is then trained with anchors separated into positive and negative samples according to their probabilities. Moreover, we investigate the gap between the training and testing objectives and propose to predict the Intersection-over-Unions of detected boxes as a measure of localization quality to reduce the discrepancy. The combined score of classification and localization qualities serving as a box selection metric in non-maximum suppression well aligns with the proposed anchor assignment strategy and leads significant performance improvements. The proposed methods only add a single convolutional layer to RetinaNet baseline and does not require multiple anchors per location, so are efficient. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Especially, our models set new records for single-stage detectors on MS COCO test-dev dataset with various backbones.

object detection,Recurrent Vision Transformers for Object Detection with Event Cameras,"We present Recurrent Vision Transformers (RVTs), a novel backbone for object detection with event cameras. Event cameras provide visual information with submillisecond latency at a high-dynamic range and with strong robustness against motion blur. These unique properties offer great potential for low-latency object detection and tracking in time-critical scenarios. Prior work in event-based vision has achieved outstanding detection performance but at the cost of substantial inference time, typically beyond 40 milliseconds. By revisiting the high-level design of recurrent vision backbones, we reduce inference time by a factor of 6 while retaining similar performance. To achieve this, we explore a multi-stage design that utilizes three key concepts in each stage: first, a convolutional prior that can be regarded as a conditional positional embedding. Second, local and dilated global self-attention for spatial feature interaction. Third, recurrent temporal feature aggregation to minimize latency while retaining temporal information. RVTs can be trained from scratch to reach state-of-the-art performance on event-based object detection - achieving an mAP of 47.2% on the Gen1 automotive dataset. At the same time, RVTs offer fast inference (< 12 ms on a T4 GPU) and favorable parameter efficiency (5 × fewer than prior art).

Recent approaches have achieved excellent results on very large benchmarks for object detection and viewpoint estimation. However, performances are still lagging behind for novel object categories with few samples. In this paper, we tackle the problems of few-shot object detection and few-shot viewpoint estimation.

Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on a range of datasets, including PASCAL and COCO for few-shot object detection, and Pascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D for few-shot viewpoint estimation. Furthermore, when the 3D model is not available, we introduce a simple category-agnostic viewpoint estimation method by exploiting geometrical similarities and consistent pose labeling across different classes.

object detection,SMOKE: Single-Stage Monocular 3D Object Detection via Keypoint Estimation,"Estimating 3D orientation and translation of objects is essential for infrastructure-less autonomous navigation and driving. In case of monocular vision, successful methods have been mainly based on two ingredients: (i) a network generating 2D region proposals, (ii) a R-CNN structure predicting 3D object pose by utilizing the acquired regions of interest. We argue that the 2D detection network is redundant and introduces non-negligible noise for 3D detection. Hence, we propose a novel 3D object detection method, named SMOKE, in this paper that predicts a 3D bounding box for each detected object by combining a single keypoint estimate with regressed 3D variables. As a second contribution, we propose a multi-step disentangling approach for constructing the 3D bounding box, which significantly improves both training convergence and detection accuracy. In contrast to previous 3D detection techniques, our method does not require complicated pre/post-processing, extra data, and a refinement stage.

object detection,Unbiased Mean Teacher for Cross-domain Object Detection,"Cross-domain object detection is challenging, because object detection model is often vulnerable to data variance, especially to the considerable domain shift between two distinctive domains. In this paper, we propose a new Unbiased Mean Teacher (UMT) model for cross-domain object detection. We reveal that there often exists a considerable model bias for the simple mean teacher (MT) model in cross-domain scenarios, and eliminate the model bias with several simple yet highly effective strategies. In particular, for the teacher model, we propose a cross-domain distillation method for MT to maximally exploit the expertise of the teacher model. Moreover, for the student model, we alleviate its bias by augmenting training samples with pixel-level adaptation. Finally, for the teaching process, we employ an out-of-distribution estimation strategy to select samples that most fit the current model to further enhance the cross-domain distillation process. By tackling the model bias issue with these strategies, our UMT model achieves mAPs of 44.1%, 58.1%, 41.7%, and 43.1% on benchmark datasets Clipart1k, Watercolor2k, Foggy Cityscapes, and Cityscapes, respectively, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art results in notable margins.

object detection,Improving 3D Object Detection with Channel-wise Transformer,"Though 3D object detection from point clouds has achieved rapid progress in recent years, the lack of flexible and high-performance proposal refinement remains a great hurdle for existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors. Previous works on refining 3D proposals have relied on human-designed components such as keypoints sampling, set abstraction and multi-scale feature fusion to produce powerful 3D object representations. Such methods, however, have limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In this paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a Channel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object detection framework (CT3D) with minimal hand-crafted design. The proposed CT3D simultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context aggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D uses proposal’s keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention propagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings. Next, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via channel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which contributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent scalability.

object detection,Towards Large-Scale Small Object Detection: Survey and Benchmarks,"With the rise of deep convolutional neural networks, object detection has achieved prominent advances in past years. However, such prosperity could not camouflage the unsatisfactory situation of Small Object Detection (SOD), one of the notoriously challenging tasks in computer vision, owing to the poor visual appearance and noisy representation caused by the intrinsic structure of small targets. In addition, large-scale dataset for benchmarking small object detection methods remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we first conduct a thorough review of small object detection. Then, to catalyze the development of SOD, we construct two large-scale Small Object Detection dAtasets (SODA), SODA-D and SODA-A, which focus on the Driving and Aerial scenarios respectively. SODA-D includes 24828 high-quality traffic images and 278433 instances of nine categories. For SODA-A, we harvest 2513 high resolution aerial images and annotate 872069 instances over nine classes.

object detection,A Small-Sized Object Detection Oriented Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Approach With Application to Defect Detection,"Object detection is a well-known task in the field of computer vision, especially the small target detection problem that has aroused great academic attention. In order to improve the detection performance of small objects, in this article, a novel enhanced multiscale feature fusion method is proposed, namely, the atrous spatial pyramid pooling-balanced-feature pyramid network (ABFPN). In particular, the atrous convolution operators with different dilation rates are employed to make full use of context information, where the skip connection is applied to achieve sufficient feature fusions. In addition, there is a balanced module to integrate and enhance features at different levels. The performance of the proposed ABFPN is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it is a reliable and efficient feature fusion method. Furthermore, in order to validate the applicational potential in small objects, the developed ABFPN is utilized to detect surface tiny defects of the printed circuit board (PCB), which acts as the neck part of an improved PCB defect detection (IPDD) framework. While designing the IPDD, several powerful strategies are also employed to further improve the overall performance, which is evaluated via extensive ablation studies. Experiments on a public PCB defect detection database have demonstrated the superiority of the designed IPDD framework against the other seven state-of-the-art methods, which further validates the practicality of the proposed ABFPN.","Nianyin Zeng, P.

object detection,DetCo: Unsupervised Contrastive Learning for Object Detection,"We present DetCo, a simple yet effective self-supervised approach for object detection. Unsupervised pre-training methods have been recently designed for object detection, but they are usually deficient in image classification, or the opposite. Unlike them, DetCo transfers well on downstream instance-level dense prediction tasks, while maintaining competitive image-level classification accuracy. The advantages are derived from (1) multi-level supervision to intermediate representations, (2) contrastive learning between global image and local patches. These two designs facilitate discriminative and consistent global and local representation at each level of feature pyramid, improving detection and classification, simultaneously.Extensive experiments on VOC, COCO, Cityscapes, and ImageNet demonstrate that DetCo not only outperforms recent methods on a series of 2D and 3D instance-level detection tasks, but also competitive on image classification. For example, on ImageNet classification, DetCo is 6.9% and 5.0% top-1 accuracy better than InsLoc and DenseCL, which are two contemporary works designed for object detection. Moreover, on COCO detection, DetCo is 6.9 AP better than SwAV with Mask R-CNN C4. Notably, DetCo largely boosts up Sparse R-CNN, a recent strong detector, from 45.0 AP to 46.5 AP (+1.5 AP), establishing a new SOTA on COCO.","Enze Xie, Jian Ding, Wenhai Wang, Xiaohang Zhan, Hang Xu, Zhenguo Li, P.

object detection,SuperYOLO: Super Resolution Assisted Object Detection in Multimodal Remote Sensing Imagery,"Accurately and timely detecting multiscale small objects that contain tens of pixels from remote sensing images (RSI) remains challenging. Most of the existing solutions primarily design complex deep neural networks to learn strong feature representations for objects separated from the background, which often results in a heavy computation burden. In this article, we propose an accurate yet fast object detection method for RSI, named SuperYOLO, which fuses multimodal data and performs high-resolution (HR) object detection on multiscale objects by utilizing the assisted super resolution (SR) learning and considering both the detection accuracy and computation cost. First, we utilize a symmetric compact multimodal fusion (MF) to extract supplementary information from various data for improving small object detection in RSI. Furthermore, we design a simple and flexible SR branch to learn HR feature representations that can discriminate small objects from vast backgrounds with low-resolution (LR) input, thus further improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, to avoid introducing additional computation, the SR branch is discarded in the inference stage, and the computation of the network model is reduced due to the LR input. Experimental results show that, on the widely used VEDAI RS dataset, SuperYOLO achieves an accuracy of 75.09% (in terms of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text {mA}{{\text {P}}_{{50}}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), which is more than 10% higher than the SOTA large models, such as YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x, and RS designed YOLOrs.

object detection,CenterFusion: Center-based Radar and Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection,"The perception system in autonomous vehicles is responsible for detecting and tracking the surrounding objects. This is usually done by taking advantage of several sensing modalities to increase robustness and accuracy, which makes sensor fusion a crucial part of the perception system. In this paper, we focus on the problem of radar and camera sensor fusion and propose a middle-fusion approach to exploit both radar and camera data for 3D object detection. Our approach, called CenterFusion, first uses a center point detection network to detect objects by identifying their center points on the image. It then solves the key data association problem using a novel frustum-based method to associate the radar detections to their corresponding object’s center point. The associated radar detections are used to generate radar-based feature maps to complement the image features, and regress to object properties such as depth, rotation and velocity. We evaluate CenterFusion on the challenging nuScenes dataset, where it improves the overall nuScenes Detection Score (NDS) of the state-of-the-art camera-based algorithm by more than 12%.

object detection,"A Survey of the Four Pillars for Small Object Detection: Multiscale Representation, Contextual Information, Super-Resolution, and Region Proposal","Although great progress has been made in generic object detection by advanced deep learning techniques, detecting small objects from images is still a difficult and challenging problem in the field of computer vision due to the limited size, less appearance, and geometry cues, and the lack of large-scale datasets of small targets.

object detection,Align Deep Features for Oriented Object Detection,"The past decade has witnessed significant progress on detecting objects in aerial images that are often distributed with large-scale variations and arbitrary orientations. However, most of existing methods rely on heuristically defined anchors with different scales, angles, and aspect ratios, and usually suffer from severe misalignment between anchor boxes (ABs) and axis-aligned convolutional features, which lead to the common inconsistency between the classification score and localization accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a single-shot alignment network (S2A-Net) consisting of two modules: a feature alignment module (FAM) and an oriented detection module (ODM). The FAM can generate high-quality anchors with an anchor refinement network and adaptively align the convolutional features according to the ABs with a novel alignment convolution. The ODM first adopts active rotating filters to encode the orientation information and then produces orientation-sensitive and orientation-invariant features to alleviate the inconsistency between classification score and localization accuracy. Besides, we further explore the approach to detect objects in large-size images, which leads to a better trade-off between speed and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used aerial objects’ data sets (i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016) while keeping high efficiency.","Jiaming Han, Jian Ding, Jie Li, Guisong Xia",2020.0,827,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1360066463544a40c5dafd70152a85c437b4bf84,0.968,0.006720299041118154,object detection align deep features for oriented object detection the past decade has witnessed significant progress on detecting objects in aerial images that are often distributed with largescale variations and arbitrary orientations however most of existing methods rely on heuristically defined anchors with different scales angles and aspect ratios and usually suffer from severe misalignment between anchor boxes abs and axisaligned convolutional features which lead to the common inconsistency between the classification score and localization accuracy to address this issue we propose a singleshot alignment network s2anet consisting of two modules a feature alignment module fam and an oriented detection module odm the fam can generate highquality anchors with an anchor refinement network and adaptively align the convolutional features according to the abs with a novel alignment convolution the odm first adopts active rotating filters to encode the orientation information and then produces orientationsensitive and orientationinvariant features to alleviate the inconsistency between classification score and localization accuracy besides we further explore the approach to detect objects in largesize images which leads to a better tradeoff between speed and accuracy extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the stateoftheart performance on two commonly used aerial objects data sets ie dota and hrsc2016 while keeping high efficiency jiaming han jian ding jie li guisong xia
object detection,PolarFormer: Multi-camera 3D Object Detection with Polar Transformers,"3D object detection in autonomous driving aims to reason “what” and “where” the objects of interest present in a 3D world. Following the conventional wisdom of previous 2D object detection, existing methods often adopt the canonical Cartesian coordinate system with perpendicular axis. However, we conjugate that this does not fit the nature of the ego car’s perspective, as each onboard camera perceives the world in shape of wedge intrinsic to the imaging geometry with radical (non perpendicular) axis. Hence, in this paper we advocate the exploitation of the Polar coordinate system and propose a new Polar Transformer (PolarFormer) for more accurate 3D object detection in the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) taking as input only multi-camera 2D images. Specifically, we design a cross-attention based Polar detection head without restriction to the shape of input structure to deal with irregular Polar grids. For tackling the unconstrained object scale variations along Polar’s distance dimension, we further introduce a multi-scale Polar representation learning strategy. As a result, our model can make best use of the Polar representation rasterized via attending to the corresponding image observation in a sequence-to-sequence fashion subject to the geometric constraints.

object detection,Shape-Adaptive Selection and Measurement for Oriented Object Detection,"The development of detection methods for oriented object detection remains a challenging task. A considerable obstacle is the wide variation in the shape (e.g., aspect ratio) of objects. Sample selection in general object detection has been widely studied as it plays a crucial role in the performance of the detection method and has achieved great progress. However, existing sample selection strategies still overlook some issues: (1) most of them ignore the object shape information; (2) they do not make a potential distinction between selected positive samples; and (3) some of them can only be applied to either anchor-free or anchor-based methods and cannot be used for both of them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose novel flexible shape-adaptive selection (SA-S) and shape-adaptive measurement (SA-M) strategies for oriented object detection, which comprise an SA-S strategy for sample selection and SA-M strategy for the quality estimation of positive samples. Specifically, the SA-S strategy dynamically selects samples according to the shape information and characteristics distribution of objects. The SA-M strategy measures the localization potential and adds quality information on the selected positive samples.

object detection,Delving into Localization Errors for Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Estimating 3D bounding boxes from monocular images is an essential component in autonomous driving, while accurate 3D object detection from this kind of data is very challenging. In this work, by intensive diagnosis experiments, we quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found the ‘localization error’ is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides, we also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors, analyze the issues they might bring, and propose three strategies. First, we revisit the misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center of the 3D object, which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy. Second, we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing technologies is almost impossible, while those samples will mislead the learned network. To this end, we propose to remove such samples from the training set for improving the overall performance of the detector. Lastly, we also propose a novel 3D IoU oriented loss for the size estimation of the object, which is not affected by ‘localization error’.

object detection,Multi-Scale Positive Sample Refinement for Few-Shot Object Detection,"Few-shot object detection (FSOD) helps detectors adapt to unseen classes with few training instances, and is useful when manual annotation is time-consuming or data acquisition is limited. Unlike previous attempts that exploit few-shot classification techniques to facilitate FSOD, this work highlights the necessity of handling the problem of scale variations, which is challenging due to the unique sample distribution. To this end, we propose a Multi-scale Positive Sample Refinement (MPSR) approach to enrich object scales in FSOD. It generates multi-scale positive samples as object pyramids and refines the prediction at various scales. We demonstrate its advantage by integrating it as an auxiliary branch to the popular architecture of Faster R-CNN with FPN, delivering a strong FSOD solution.

object detection,Deeply Supervised Salient Object Detection with Short Connections,"Recent progress on salient object detection is substantial, benefiting mostly from the explosive development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Semantic segmentation and salient object detection algorithms developed lately have been mostly based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs). There is still a large room for improvement over the generic FCN models that do not explicitly deal with the scale-space problem. The Holistically-Nested Edge Detector (HED) provides a skip-layer structure with deep supervision for edge and boundary detection, but the performance gain of HED on saliency detection is not obvious. In this paper, we propose a new salient object detection method by introducing short connections to the skip-layer structures within the HED architecture. Our framework takes full advantage of multi-level and multi-scale features extracted from FCNs, providing more advanced representations at each layer, a property that is critically needed to perform segment detection. Our method produces state-of-the-art results on 5 widely tested salient object detection benchmarks, with advantages in terms of efficiency (0.08 seconds per image), effectiveness, and simplicity over the existing algorithms. Beyond that, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of the role of training data on performance.

object detection,UP-DETR: Unsupervised Pre-training for Object Detection with Transformers,"Object detection with transformers (DETR) reaches competitive performance with Faster R-CNN via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to Unsupervisedly Pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization preferences in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and attention mask. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher average precision on object detection, one-shot detection and panoptic segmentation.

However, it has been surprisingly difficult to train networks to effectively use both modalities in a way that demonstrates gain over single-modality networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Camera-LiDAR Object Candidates (CLOCs) fusion network. CLOCs fusion provides a low-complexity multi-modal fusion framework that significantly improves the performance of single-modality detectors. CLOCs operates on the combined output candidates before Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) of any 2D and any 3D detector, and is trained to leverage their geometric and semantic consistencies to produce more accurate final 3D and 2D detection results. Our experimental evaluation on the challenging KITTI object detection benchmark, including 3D and bird's eye view metrics, shows significant improvements, especially at long distance, over the state-of-the-art fusion based methods.

object detection,FairMOT: On the Fairness of Detection and Re-identification in Multiple Object Tracking,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important problem in computer vision which has a wide range of applications. Formulating MOT as multi-task learning of object detection and re-ID in a single network is appealing since it allows joint optimization of the two tasks and enjoys high computation efficiency. However, we find that the two tasks tend to compete with each other which need to be carefully addressed. In particular, previous works usually treat re-ID as a secondary task whose accuracy is heavily affected by the primary detection task. As a result, the network is biased to the primary detection task which is not fair to the re-ID task. To solve the problem, we present a simple yet effective approach termed as FairMOT based on the anchor-free object detection architecture CenterNet. Note that it is not a naive combination of CenterNet and re-ID. Instead, we present a bunch of detailed designs which are critical to achieve good tracking results by thorough empirical studies. The resulting approach achieves high accuracy for both detection and tracking. The approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several public datasets.

object detection,The KFIoU Loss for Rotated Object Detection,"Differing from the well-developed horizontal object detection area whereby the computing-friendly IoU based loss is readily adopted and well fits with the detection metrics. In contrast, rotation detectors often involve a more complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based training. In this paper, we propose an effective approximate SkewIoU loss based on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items. The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within a certain distance (i.e. within 9 pixels). This is in contrast to recent Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD loss and KLD loss that involve a human-specified distribution distance metric which require additional hyperparameter tuning that vary across datasets and detectors. The resulting new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D. Extensive results on various public datasets (2-D/3-D, aerial/text/face images) with different base detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.","Xue Yang, Yue Zhou, Gefan Zhang, Jitui Yang, Wentao Wang, Junchi Yan, Xiaopeng Zhang, Q.

Going beyond these sub-optimal frameworks, we propose a simple online model named Chained-Tracker (CTracker), which naturally integrates all the three subtasks into an end-to-end solution (the first as far as we know). It chains paired bounding boxes regression results estimated from overlapping nodes, of which each node covers two adjacent frames. The paired regression is made attentive by object-attention (brought by a detection module) and identity-attention (ensured by an ID verification module).

However, most existing FCNs-based methods still suffer from coarse object boundaries. In this paper, to solve this problem, we focus on the complementarity between salient edge information and salient object information. Accordingly, we present an edge guidance network (EGNet) for salient object detection with three steps to simultaneously model these two kinds of complementary information in a single network. In the ﬁrst step, we extract the salient object features by a progressive fusion way. In the second step, we integrate the local edge information and global location information to obtain the salient edge features. Finally, to sufﬁciently leverage these complementary features, we couple the same salient edge features with salient object features at various resolutions. Beneﬁting from the rich edge information and location information in salient edge features, the fused features can help locate salient objects, especially their boundaries more accurately.

object detection,Learning RoI Transformer for Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images,"Object detection in aerial images is an active yet challenging task in computer vision because of the bird’s-eye view perspective, the highly complex backgrounds, and the variant appearances of objects. Especially when detecting densely packed objects in aerial images, methods relying on horizontal proposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the Region of Interests (RoIs) and objects. This leads to the common misalignment between the final object classification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a RoI Transformer to address these problems. The core idea of RoI Transformer is to apply spatial transformations on RoIs and learn the transformation parameters under the supervision of oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations. RoI Transformer is with lightweight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object detection. Simply apply the RoI Transformer to light head RCNN has achieved state-of-the-art performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets, i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016, with a neglectable reduction to detection speed.

object detection,A Simple Pooling-Based Design for Real-Time Salient Object Detection,"We solve the problem of salient object detection by investigating how to expand the role of pooling in convolutional neural networks. Based on the U-shape architecture, we first build a global guidance module (GGM) upon the bottom-up pathway, aiming at providing layers at different feature levels the location information of potential salient objects. We further design a feature aggregation module (FAM) to make the coarse-level semantic information well fused with the fine-level features from the top-down path- way. By adding FAMs after the fusion operations in the top-down pathway, coarse-level features from the GGM can be seamlessly merged with features at various scales. These two pooling-based modules allow the high-level semantic features to be progressively refined, yielding detail enriched saliency maps. Experiment results show that our proposed approach can more accurately locate the salient objects with sharpened details and hence substantially improve the performance compared to the previous state-of-the-arts. Our approach is fast as well and can run at a speed of more than 30 FPS when processing a 300×400 image.

object detection,Single-Shot Refinement Neural Network for Object Detection,"For object detection, the two-stage approach (e.g., Faster R-CNN) has been achieving the highest accuracy, whereas the one-stage approach (e.g., SSD) has the advantage of high efficiency. To inherit the merits of both while overcoming their disadvantages, in this paper, we propose a novel single-shot based detector, called RefineDet, that achieves better accuracy than two-stage methods and maintains comparable efficiency of one-stage methods. RefineDet consists of two inter-connected modules, namely, the anchor refinement module and the object detection module. Specifically, the former aims to (1) filter out negative anchors to reduce search space for the classifier, and (2) coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent regressor. The latter module takes the refined anchors as the input from the former to further improve the regression accuracy and predict multi-class label. Meanwhile, we design a transfer connection block to transfer the features in the anchor refinement module to predict locations, sizes and class labels of objects in the object detection module. The multitask loss function enables us to train the whole network in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO demonstrate that RefineDet achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high efficiency.

object detection,Cascaded Partial Decoder for Fast and Accurate Salient Object Detection,"Existing state-of-the-art salient object detection networks rely on aggregating multi-level features of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, compared to high-level features, low-level features contribute less to performance. Meanwhile, they raise more computational cost because of their larger spatial resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascaded Partial Decoder (CPD) framework for fast and accurate salient object detection. On the one hand, the framework constructs partial decoder which discards larger resolution features of shallow layers for acceleration. On the other hand, we observe that integrating features of deep layers will obtain relatively precise saliency map. Therefore we directly utilize generated saliency map to recurrently optimize features of deep layers. This strategy efficiently suppresses distractors in the features and significantly improves their representation ability. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets exhibit that the proposed model not only achieves state-of-the-art but also runs much faster than existing models. Besides, we apply the proposed framework to optimize existing multi-level feature aggregation models and significantly improve their efficiency and accuracy.","Zhe Wu, Li Su, Qingming Huang",2019.0,854,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66ce56946214ab496c260012d828f7883ebfca22,0.9600000000000009,0.006939704209328783,object detection cascaded partial decoder for fast and accurate salient object detection existing stateoftheart salient object detection networks rely on aggregating multilevel features of pretrained convolutional neural networks cnns however compared to highlevel features lowlevel features contribute less to performance meanwhile they raise more computational cost because of their larger spatial resolutions in this paper we propose a novel cascaded partial decoder cpd framework for fast and accurate salient object detection on the one hand the framework constructs partial decoder which discards larger resolution features of shallow layers for acceleration on the other hand we observe that integrating features of deep layers will obtain relatively precise saliency map therefore we directly utilize generated saliency map to recurrently optimize features of deep layers this strategy efficiently suppresses distractors in the features and significantly improves their representation ability experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets exhibit that the proposed model not only achieves stateoftheart but also runs much faster than existing models besides we apply the proposed framework to optimize existing multilevel feature aggregation models and significantly improve their efficiency and accuracy zhe wu li su qingming huang
object detection,Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images,"Object detection in Earth Vision has achieved great progress in recent years. However, tiny object detection in aerial images remains a very challenging problem since the tiny objects contain a small number of pixels and are easily confused with the background. To advance tiny object detection research in aerial images, we present a new dataset for Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images (AI-TOD). Specifically, AI-TOD comes with 700,621 object instances for eight categories across 28,036 aerial images. Compared to existing object detection datasets in aerial images, the mean size of objects in AI-TOD is about 12.8 pixels, which is much smaller than others. To build a benchmark for tiny object detection in aerial images, we evaluate the state-of-the-art object detectors on our AI-TOD dataset. Experimental results show that direct application of these approaches on AI-TOD produces suboptimal object detection results, thus new specialized detectors for tiny object detection need to be designed. Therefore, we propose a multiple center points based learning network (M-CenterNet) to improve the localization performance of tiny object detection, and experimental results show the significant performance gain over the competitors.","Jinwang Wang, Wen Yang, Haowen Guo, Ruixiang Zhang, Guisong Xia",2021.0,213,International Conference on Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9db792a456f76517783a965ac3a127c985adcb5,0.9759999999999991,0.0017308629936616286,object detection tiny object detection in aerial images object detection in earth vision has achieved great progress in recent years however tiny object detection in aerial images remains a very challenging problem since the tiny objects contain a small number of pixels and are easily confused with the background to advance tiny object detection research in aerial images we present a new dataset for tiny object detection in aerial images aitod specifically aitod comes with 700621 object instances for eight categories across 28036 aerial images compared to existing object detection datasets in aerial images the mean size of objects in aitod is about 128 pixels which is much smaller than others to build a benchmark for tiny object detection in aerial images we evaluate the stateoftheart object detectors on our aitod dataset experimental results show that direct application of these approaches on aitod produces suboptimal object detection results thus new specialized detectors for tiny object detection need to be designed therefore we propose a multiple center points based learning network mcenternet to improve the localization performance of tiny object detection and experimental results show the significant performance gain over the competitors jinwang wang wen yang haowen guo ruixiang zhang guisong xia
object detection,QueryDet: Cascaded Sparse Query for Accelerating High-Resolution Small Object Detection,"While general object detection with deep learning has achieved great success in the past few years, the performance and efficiency of detecting small objects are far from satisfactory. The most common and effective way to promote small object detection is to use high-resolution images or feature maps. However, both approaches induce costly computation since the computational cost grows squarely as the size of images and features increases. To get the best of two worlds, we propose QueryDet that uses a novel query mechanism to accelerate the inference speed of feature-pyramid based object detectors. The pipeline composes two steps: it first predicts the coarse locations of small objects on low-resolution features and then computes the accurate detection results using high-resolution features sparsely guided by those coarse positions. In this way, we can not only harvest the benefit of high-resolution feature maps but also avoid useless computation for the background area. On the popular COCO dataset, the proposed method improves the detection mAP by 1.0 and mAP-small by 2.0, and the high-resolution inference speed is improved to 3.0× on average.

object detection,Calibrated RGB-D Salient Object Detection,"Complex backgrounds and similar appearances between objects and their surroundings are generally recognized as challenging scenarios in Salient Object Detection (SOD). This naturally leads to the incorporation of depth information in addition to the conventional RGB image as input, known as RGB-D SOD or depth-aware SOD. Meanwhile, this emerging line of research has been considerably hindered by the noise and ambiguity that prevail in raw depth images. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Depth Calibration and Fusion (DCF) framework that contains two novel components: 1) a learning strategy to calibrate the latent bias in the original depth maps towards boosting the SOD performance; 2) a simple yet effective cross reference module to fuse features from both RGB and depth modalities. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance against 27 state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our depth calibration strategy alone can work as a preprocessing step; empirically it results in noticeable improvements when being applied to existing cutting-edge RGB-D SOD models.

More importantly, by leveraging the self attention of the transformer, the network can naturally carry out simultaneous intra-modality and inter-modality fusion, and robustly capture the latent interactions between RGB and Thermal domains, thereby significantly improving the performance of multispectral object detection.

object detection,Weakly-Supervised Salient Object Detection via Scribble Annotations,"Compared with laborious pixel-wise dense labeling, it is much easier to label data by scribbles, which only costs 1~2 seconds to label one image. However, using scribble labels to learn salient object detection has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised salient object detection model to learn saliency from such annotations. In doing so, we first relabel an existing large-scale salient object detection dataset with scribbles, namely S-DUTS dataset. Since object structure and detail information is not identified by scribbles, directly training with scribble labels will lead to saliency maps of poor boundary localization. To mitigate this problem, we propose an auxiliary edge detection task to localize object edges explicitly, and a gated structure-aware loss to place constraints on the scope of structure to be recovered. Moreover, we design a scribble boosting scheme to iteratively consolidate our scribble annotations, which are then employed as supervision to learn high-quality saliency maps. As existing saliency evaluation metrics neglect to measure structure alignment of the predictions, the saliency map ranking may not comply with human perception. We present a new metric, termed saliency structure measure, as a complementary metric to evaluate sharpness of the prediction. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing weakly-supervised/unsupervised methods, but also is on par with several fully-supervised state-of-the-art models (Our code and data is publicly available at: https://github.com/JingZhang617/Scribble_Saliency).","Jing Zhang, Xin Yu, Aixuan Li, Peipei Song, Bowen Liu, Yuchao Dai",2020.0,274,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b22e74be741d7852c995348e566bef58b9a3d40b,0.968,0.0022265561514708274,object detection weaklysupervised salient object detection via scribble annotations compared with laborious pixelwise dense labeling it is much easier to label data by scribbles which only costs 12 seconds to label one image however using scribble labels to learn salient object detection has not been explored in this paper we propose a weaklysupervised salient object detection model to learn saliency from such annotations in doing so we first relabel an existing largescale salient object detection dataset with scribbles namely sduts dataset since object structure and detail information is not identified by scribbles directly training with scribble labels will lead to saliency maps of poor boundary localization to mitigate this problem we propose an auxiliary edge detection task to localize object edges explicitly and a gated structureaware loss to place constraints on the scope of structure to be recovered moreover we design a scribble boosting scheme to iteratively consolidate our scribble annotations which are then employed as supervision to learn highquality saliency maps as existing saliency evaluation metrics neglect to measure structure alignment of the predictions the saliency map ranking may not comply with human perception we present a new metric termed saliency structure measure as a complementary metric to evaluate sharpness of the prediction extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing weaklysupervisedunsupervised methods but also is on par with several fullysupervised stateoftheart models our code and data is publicly available at httpsgithubcomjingzhang617scribble_saliency jing zhang xin yu aixuan li peipei song bowen liu yuchao dai

object detection,Exploring Categorical Regularization for Domain Adaptive Object Detection,"In this paper, we tackle the domain adaptive object detection problem, where the main challenge lies in significant domain gaps between source and target domains. Previous work seeks to plainly align image-level and instance-level shifts to eventually minimize the domain discrepancy. However, they still overlook to match crucial image regions and important instances across domains, which will strongly affect domain shift mitigation. In this work, we propose a simple but effective categorical regularization framework for alleviating this issue. It can be applied as a plug-and-play component on a series of Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN methods which are prominent for dealing with domain adaptive detection. Specifically, by integrating an image-level multi-label classifier upon the detection backbone, we can obtain the sparse but crucial image regions corresponding to categorical information, thanks to the weakly localization ability of the classification manner. Meanwhile, at the instance level, we leverage the categorical consistency between image-level predictions (by the classifier) and instance-level predictions (by the detection head) as a regularization factor to automatically hunt for the hard aligned instances of target domains. Extensive experiments of various domain shift scenarios show that our method obtains a significant performance gain over original Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN detectors. Furthermore, qualitative visualization and analyses can demonstrate the ability of our method for attending on the key regions/instances targeting on domain adaptation.

object detection,Centralized Feature Pyramid for Object Detection,"The visual feature pyramid has shown its superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency in a variety of applications. However, current methods overly focus on inter-layer feature interactions while disregarding the importance of intra-layer feature regulation. Despite some attempts to learn a compact intra-layer feature representation with the use of attention mechanisms or vision transformers, they overlook the crucial corner regions that are essential for dense prediction tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP) network for object detection, which is based on a globally explicit centralized feature regulation. Specifically, we first propose a spatial explicit visual center scheme, where a lightweight MLP is used to capture the globally long-range dependencies, and a parallel learnable visual center mechanism is used to capture the local corner regions of the input images. Based on this, we then propose a globally centralized regulation for the commonly-used feature pyramid in a top-down fashion, where the explicit visual center information obtained from the deepest intra-layer feature is used to regulate frontal shallow features. Compared to the existing feature pyramids, CFP not only has the ability to capture the global long-range dependencies but also efficiently obtain an all-round yet discriminative feature representation.

object detection,AO2-DETR: Arbitrary-Oriented Object Detection Transformer,"Arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) is a challenging task to detect objects in the wild with arbitrary orientations and cluttered arrangements. Existing approaches are mainly based on anchor-based boxes or dense points, which rely on complicated hand-designed processing steps and inductive bias, such as anchor generation, transformation, and non-maximum suppression reasoning. Recently, the emerging transformer-based approaches view object detection as a direct set prediction problem that effectively removes the need for hand-designed components and inductive biases. In this paper, we propose an Arbitrary-Oriented Object DEtection TRansformer framework, termed AO2-DETR, which comprises three dedicated components. More precisely, an oriented proposal generation mechanism is proposed to explicitly generate oriented proposals, which provides better positional priors for pooling features to modulate the cross-attention in the transformer decoder. An adaptive oriented proposal refinement module is introduced to extract rotation-invariant region features and eliminate the misalignment between region features and objects. And a rotation-aware set matching loss is used to ensure the one-to-one matching process for direct set prediction without duplicate predictions. Our method considerably simplifies the overall pipeline and presents a new AOOD paradigm.

object detection,Uncertainty-Guided Transformer Reasoning for Camouflaged Object Detection,"Spotting objects that are visually adapted to their surroundings is challenging for both humans and AI. Conventional generic / salient object detection techniques are suboptimal for this task because they tend to only discover easy and clear objects, while overlooking the difficult-to-detect ones with inherent uncertainties derived from indistinguishable textures. In this work, we contribute a novel approach using a probabilistic representational model in combination with transformers to explicitly reason under uncertainties, namely uncertainty-guided transformer reasoning (UGTR), for camouflaged object detection. The core idea is to first learn a conditional distribution over the backbone's output to obtain initial estimates and associated uncertainties, and then reason over these uncertain regions with attention mechanism to produce final predictions. Our approach combines the benefits of both Bayesian learning and Transformer-based reasoning, allowing the model to handle camouflaged object detection by leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic information.

object detection,Strong-Weak Distribution Alignment for Adaptive Object Detection,"We propose an approach for unsupervised adaptation of object detectors from label-rich to label-poor domains which can significantly reduce annotation costs associated with detection. Recently, approaches that align distributions of source and target images using an adversarial loss have been proven effective for adapting object classifiers. However, for object detection, fully matching the entire distributions of source and target images to each other at the global image level may fail, as domains could have distinct scene layouts and different combinations of objects. On the other hand, strong matching of local features such as texture and color makes sense, as it does not change category level semantics. This motivates us to propose a novel method for detector adaptation based on strong local alignment and weak global alignment. Our key contribution is the weak alignment model, which focuses the adversarial alignment loss on images that are globally similar and puts less emphasis on aligning images that are globally dissimilar. Additionally, we design the strong domain alignment model to only look at local receptive fields of the feature map. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method on four datasets comprising both large and small domain shifts.

object detection,SF-YOLOv5: A Lightweight Small Object Detection Algorithm Based on Improved Feature Fusion Mode,"In the research of computer vision, a very challenging problem is the detection of small objects. The existing detection algorithms often focus on detecting full-scale objects, without making proprietary optimization for detecting small-size objects. For small objects dense scenes, not only the accuracy is low, but also there is a certain waste of computing resources. An improved detection algorithm was proposed for small objects based on YOLOv5. By reasonably clipping the feature map output of the large object detection layer, the computing resources required by the model were significantly reduced and the model becomes more lightweight. An improved feature fusion method (PB-FPN) for small object detection based on PANet and BiFPN was proposed, which effectively increased the detection ability for small object of the algorithm. By introducing the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) in the backbone network into the feature fusion network and connecting with the model prediction head, the performance of the algorithm was effectively enhanced. The experiments demonstrated that the improved algorithm has very good results in detection accuracy and real-time ability. Compared with the classical YOLOv5, the mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 of SF-YOLOv5 were increased by 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively, the number of parameters of the network were reduced by 68.2%, computational resources (FLOPs) were reduced by 12.7%, and the inferring time of the mode was reduced by 6.9%.","Haiying Liu, Fengqian Sun, J.

object detection,Swin-Transformer-Enabled YOLOv5 with Attention Mechanism for Small Object Detection on Satellite Images,"Object detection has made tremendous progress in natural images over the last decade. However, the results are hardly satisfactory when the natural image object detection algorithm is directly applied to satellite images. This is due to the intrinsic differences in the scale and orientation of objects generated by the bird’s-eye perspective of satellite photographs. Moreover, the background of satellite images is complex and the object area is small; as a result, small objects tend to be missing due to the challenge of feature extraction. Dense objects overlap and occlusion also affects the detection performance. Although the self-attention mechanism was introduced to detect small objects, the computational complexity increased with the image’s resolution. We modified the general one-stage detector YOLOv5 to adapt the satellite images to resolve the above problems. First, new feature fusion layers and a prediction head are added from the shallow layer for small object detection for the first time because it can maximally preserve the feature information. Second, the original convolutional prediction heads are replaced with Swin Transformer Prediction Heads (SPHs) for the first time. SPH represents an advanced self-attention mechanism whose shifted window design can reduce the computational complexity to linearity. Finally, Normalization-based Attention Modules (NAMs) are integrated into YOLOv5 to improve attention performance in a normalized way. The improved YOLOv5 is termed SPH-YOLOv5. It is evaluated on the NWPU-VHR10 dataset and DOTA dataset, which are widely used for satellite image object detection evaluations. Compared with the basal YOLOv5, SPH-YOLOv5 improves the mean Average Precision (mAP) by 0.071 on the DOTA dataset.","Hang Gong, Tingkui Mu, Qiuxia Li, H.

object detection,Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Techniques for Remote Sensing Images: A Survey,"Object detection in remote sensing images (RSIs) requires the locating and classifying of objects of interest, which is a hot topic in RSI analysis research. With the development of deep learning (DL) technology, which has accelerated in recent years, numerous intelligent and efficient detection algorithms have been proposed. Meanwhile, the performance of remote sensing imaging hardware has also evolved significantly. The detection technology used with high-resolution RSIs has been pushed to unprecedented heights, making important contributions in practical applications such as urban detection, building planning, and disaster prediction. However, although some scholars have authored reviews on DL-based object detection systems, the leading DL-based object detection improvement strategies have never been summarized in detail. In this paper, we first briefly review the recent history of remote sensing object detection (RSOD) techniques, including traditional methods as well as DL-based methods. Then, we systematically summarize the procedures used in DL-based detection algorithms.

object detection,Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection,"As the perception range of LiDAR increases, LiDAR-based 3D object detection becomes a dominant task in the long-range perception task of autonomous driving. The mainstream 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the network backbone and prediction head. However, the computational and spatial costs on the dense feature map are quadratic to the perception range, which makes them hardly scale up to the long-range setting. To enable efficient long-range LiDAR-based object detection, we build a fully sparse 3D object detector (FSD). The computational and spatial cost of FSD is roughly linear to the number of points and independent of the perception range. FSD is built upon the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR) module. SIR first groups the points into instances and then applies instance-wise feature extraction and prediction. In this way, SIR resolves the issue of center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse architecture for all center-based or anchor-based detectors. Moreover, SIR avoids the time-consuming neighbor queries in previous point-based methods by grouping points into instances. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset to reveal the working mechanism of FSD, and state-of-the-art performance is reported. To demonstrate the superiority of FSD in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset, which has a much larger perception range ($200m$) than Waymo Open Dataset ($75m$). On such a large perception range, FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is 2.4$\times$ faster than the dense counterpart.

object detection,FedVision: An Online Visual Object Detection Platform Powered by Federated Learning,"Visual object detection is a computer vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) technique which has many practical applications (e.g., fire hazard monitoring). However, due to privacy concerns and the high cost of transmitting video data, it is highly challenging to build object detection models on centrally stored large training datasets following the current approach. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to resolve this challenge. Nevertheless, there currently lacks an easy to use tool to enable computer vision application developers who are not experts in federated learning to conveniently leverage this technology and apply it in their systems. In this paper, we report FedVision - a machine learning engineering platform to support the development of federated learning powered computer vision applications.

object detection,Salient Object Detection: A Benchmark,"We extensively compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, 41 state-of-the-art models (29 salient object detection, 10 fixation prediction, 1 objectness, and 1 baseline) over seven challenging data sets for the purpose of benchmarking salient object detection and segmentation methods. From the results obtained so far, our evaluation shows a consistent rapid progress over the last few years in terms of both accuracy and running time. The top contenders in this benchmark significantly outperform the models identified as the best in the previous benchmark conducted three years ago. We find that the models designed specifically for salient object detection generally work better than models in closely related areas, which in turn provides a precise definition and suggests an appropriate treatment of this problem that distinguishes it from other problems. In particular, we analyze the influences of center bias and scene complexity in model performance, which, along with the hard cases for the state-of-the-art models, provide useful hints toward constructing more challenging large-scale data sets and better saliency models.

object detection,Bottom-Up Object Detection by Grouping Extreme and Center Points,"With the advent of deep learning, object detection drifted from a bottom-up to a top-down recognition problem. State of the art algorithms enumerate a near-exhaustive list of object locations and classify each into: object or not. In this paper, we show that bottom-up approaches still perform competitively. We detect four extreme points (top-most, left-most, bottom-most, right-most) and one center point of objects using a standard keypoint estimation network. We group the five keypoints into a bounding box if they are geometrically aligned. Object detection is then a purely appearance-based keypoint estimation problem, without region classification or implicit feature learning. The proposed method performs on-par with the state-of-the-art region based detection methods, with a bounding box AP of 43.7% on COCO test-dev. In addition, our estimated extreme points directly span a coarse octagonal mask, with a COCO Mask AP of 18.9%, much better than the Mask AP of vanilla bounding boxes.

object detection,Small Object Detection Method Based on Adaptive Spatial Parallel Convolution and Fast Multi-Scale Fusion,"As one type of object detection, small object detection has been widely used in daily-life-related applications with many real-time requirements, such as autopilot and navigation. Although deep-learning-based object detection methods have achieved great success in recent years, they are not effective in small object detection and most of them cannot achieve real-time processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a single-stage small object detection network (SODNet) that integrates the specialized feature extraction and information fusion techniques. An adaptively spatial parallel convolution module (ASPConv) is proposed to alleviate the lack of spatial information for target objects and adaptively obtain the corresponding spatial information through multi-scale receptive fields, thereby improving the feature extraction ability. Additionally, a split-fusion sub-module (SF) is proposed to effectively reduce the time complexity of ASPConv. A fast multi-scale fusion module (FMF) is proposed to alleviate the insufficient fusion of both semantic and spatial information. FMF uses two fast upsampling operators to first unify the resolution of the multi-scale feature maps extracted by the network and then fuse them, thereby effectively improving the small object detection ability. Comparative experimental results prove that the proposed method considerably improves the accuracy of small object detection on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves a high real-time performance.","Guanqiu Qi, Yuanchuan Zhang, Kunpeng Wang, Neal Mazur, Yang Liu, Devanshi Malaviya",2022.0,106,Remote Sensing,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc4137dffbf101aab5175624932bf311134462b4,0.9840000000000018,0.0008613684381602471,object detection small object detection method based on adaptive spatial parallel convolution and fast multiscale fusion as one type of object detection small object detection has been widely used in dailyliferelated applications with many realtime requirements such as autopilot and navigation although deeplearningbased object detection methods have achieved great success in recent years they are not effective in small object detection and most of them cannot achieve realtime processing therefore this paper proposes a singlestage small object detection network sodnet that integrates the specialized feature extraction and information fusion techniques an adaptively spatial parallel convolution module aspconv is proposed to alleviate the lack of spatial information for target objects and adaptively obtain the corresponding spatial information through multiscale receptive fields thereby improving the feature extraction ability additionally a splitfusion submodule sf is proposed to effectively reduce the time complexity of aspconv a fast multiscale fusion module fmf is proposed to alleviate the insufficient fusion of both semantic and spatial information fmf uses two fast upsampling operators to first unify the resolution of the multiscale feature maps extracted by the network and then fuse them thereby effectively improving the small object detection ability comparative experimental results prove that the proposed method considerably improves the accuracy of small object detection on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves a high realtime performance guanqiu qi yuanchuan zhang kunpeng wang neal mazur yang liu devanshi malaviya

object detection,PIXOR: Real-time 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds,"We address the problem of real-time 3D object detection from point clouds in the context of autonomous driving. Speed is critical as detection is a necessary component for safety. Existing approaches are, however, expensive in computation due to high dimensionality of point clouds. We utilize the 3D data more efficiently by representing the scene from the Bird's Eye View (BEV), and propose PIXOR, a proposal-free, single-stage detector that outputs oriented 3D object estimates decoded from pixel-wise neural network predictions. The input representation, network architecture, and model optimization are specially designed to balance high accuracy and real-time efficiency. We validate PIXOR on two datasets: the KITTI BEV object detection benchmark, and a large-scale 3D vehicle detection benchmark. In both datasets we show that the proposed detector surpasses other state-of-the-art methods notably in terms of Average Precision (AP), while still runs at 10 FPS.","Binh Yang, Wenjie Luo, R.

dsp,DSP: Efficient GNN Training with Multiple GPUs,"Jointly utilizing multiple GPUs to train graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial for handling large graphs and achieving high efficiency. However, we find that existing systems suffer from high communication costs and low GPU utilization due to improper data layout and training procedures. Thus, we propose a system dubbed Distributed Sampling and Pipelining (DSP) for multi-GPU GNN training. DSP adopts a tailored data layout to utilize the fast NVLink connections among the GPUs, which stores the graph topology and popular node features in GPU memory. For efficient graph sampling with multiple GPUs, we introduce a collective sampling primitive (CSP), which pushes the sampling tasks to data to reduce communication. We also design a producer-consumer-based pipeline, which allows tasks from different mini-batches to run congruently to improve GPU utilization. We compare DSP with state-of-the-art GNN training frameworks, and the results show that DSP consistently outperforms the baselines under different datasets, GNN models and GPU counts. The speedup of DSP can be up to 26x and is over 2x in most cases.","Zhenkun Cai, Qihui Zhou, Xiao Yan, Da Zheng, Xiang Song, Chenguang Zheng, James Cheng, G.

Mandheling fully explores the advantages of DSP in integer-based numerical calculations using four novel techniques: (1) a CPU-DSP co-scheduling scheme to situationally mitigate the overhead from DSP-unfriendly operators; (2) a self-adaptive rescaling algorithm to reduce the overhead of dynamic rescaling in backward propagation; (3) a batch-splitting algorithm to improve DSP cache efficiency; (4) a DSP compute subgraph-reusing mechanism to eliminate the preparation overhead on DSP. We have fully implemented Mandheling and demonstrated its effectiveness through extensive experiments. The results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art DNN engines from TFLite and MNN, Mandheling reduces per-batch training time by 5.5X and energy consumption by 8.9X on average.

dsp,DSP: Dual Soft-Paste for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper. Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight. Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/GaoLii/DSP.","Li Gao, Jing Zhang, Lefei Zhang, D.

dsp,DSP-Packing: Squeezing Low-precision Arithmetic into FPGA DSP Blocks,"The number of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) resources available in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is often quite limited. Therefore, full utilization of available DSP resources for the computationally intensive parts of an algorithm is paramount for optimizing the non-functional properties of an implementation (i.e., performance, power, and area). The DSPs available in Xilinx devices implement large bit width operators (i.e. a 48-bit accumulator or a 18 × 27 multiplier). However, using such a DSP for low-precision quantized data (as is common in image processing or machine learning applications) leaves the DSP resources underutilized. As a remedy, a method has been proposed to pack and compute four 4-bit multiplications on a single DSP in a single clock cycle. This paper presents a generalization of this scheme to arbitrary bit widths and number of multiplications. We also demonstrate that the previously proposed approach leads to errors (Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.37). Furthermore, we explain where these errors come from and how they can be corrected. On top, we introduce a novel approximate method called “Overpacking” which allows to squeeze even more multiplications into a single DSP at the cost of small errors (MAE = 0.47). Overpacking allows to squeeze six 4-bit multiplications into a single DSP compared to just four in the literature. Finally, we introduce an alternative method for packing multiple small-bit width additions into a single 48-bit accumulator for use in applications such as Spiking Neural Networks.","J.

dsp,DSP-SLAM: Object Oriented SLAM with Deep Shape Priors,"We propose DSP-SLAM, an object-oriented SLAM system that builds a rich and accurate joint map of dense 3D models for foreground objects, and sparse landmark points to represent the background. DSP-SLAM takes as input the 3D point cloud reconstructed by a feature-based SLAM system and equips it with the ability to enhance its sparse map with dense reconstructions of detected objects. Objects are detected via semantic instance segmentation, and their shape and pose are estimated using category-specific deep shape embeddings as priors, via a novel second order optimization. Our object-aware bundle adjustment builds a pose-graph to jointly optimize camera poses, object locations and feature points. DSP-SLAM can operate at 10 frames per second on 3 different input modalities: monocular, stereo, or stereo+LiDAR. We demonstrate DSP-SLAM operating at almost frame rate on monocular-RGB sequences from the Friburg and Redwood-OS datasets, and on stereo+LiDAR sequences on the KITTI odometry dataset showing that it achieves high-quality full object reconstructions, even from partial observations, while maintaining a consistent global map.

However, sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) is inevitable to reach the demanded high data rates for these short-reach applications. In this article, we compare different DSP schemes that enable rates of 200 Gb/s/λ and beyond. Those schemes include Tomlinson–Harashima precoding, partial response signaling, Viterbi equalization and post-filtering together with Volterra nonlinear equalization. Extensive experimental measurements are shown in which the DSP approaches are compared at gross rates between 180 Gb/s and 300 Gb/s. The experiments are done in C-band for fiber links of up to 2 km length. As modulation formats, PAM4, PAM6, and PAM8 are considered. Net bit rates well over 200 Gb/s are shown for all formats at a range of 1 km single mode fiber using a transmission system consisting of currently available commercial components.

dsp,Advanced DSP for Coherent Optical Fiber Communication,"In this paper, we provide an overview of recent progress on advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques for high-capacity long-haul coherent optical fiber transmission systems. Not only the linear impairments existing in optical transmission links need to be compensated, but also, the nonlinear impairments require proper algorithms for mitigation because they become major limiting factors for long-haul large-capacity optical transmission systems. Besides the time domain equalization (TDE), the frequency domain equalization (FDE) DSP also provides a similar performance, with a much-reduced computational complexity. Advanced DSP also plays an important role for the realization of space division multiplexing (SDM). SDM techniques have been developed recently to enhance the system capacity by at least one order of magnitude. Some impressive results have been reported and have outperformed the nonlinear Shannon limit of the single-mode fiber (SMF). SDM introduces the space dimension to the optical fiber communication. The few-mode fiber (FMF) and multi-core fiber (MCF) have been manufactured for novel multiplexing techniques such as mode-division multiplexing (MDM) and multi-core multiplexing (MCM). Each mode or core can be considered as an independent degree of freedom, but unfortunately, signals will suffer serious coupling during the propagation. Multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) DSP can equalize the signal coupling and makes SDM transmission feasible. The machine learning (ML) technique has attracted worldwide attention and has been explored for advanced DSP. In this paper, we firstly introduce the principle and scheme of coherent detection to explain why the DSP techniques can compensate for transmission impairments. Then corresponding technologies related to the DSP, such as nonlinearity compensation, FDE, SDM and ML will be discussed.

Digital signal processing (DSP) blocks on field-programmable gate arrays are not efficiently utilised when the accelerator precision is much lower than the DSP precision. Through three modifications to Xilinx DSP48E2 DSP blocks, we address this issue for important computations in embedded DNN accelerators, namely the standard, depth-wise, and pointwise convolutional layers. First, we propose a flexible precision, run-time decomposable multiplier architecture for CNN implementations. Second, we propose a significant upgrade to DSPDSP interconnect, providing a semi-2D low precision chaining capability which supports our low-precision multiplier. Finally, we improve data reuse via a register file which can also be configured as FIFO. Compared with the 27 × 18-bit mode in the Xilinx DSP48E2, our Precision, Interconnect, and Reuseoptimised DSP (PIR-DSP) offers a 6× improvement in multiplyaccumulate operations per DSP in the 9 × 9-bit case, 12× for 4 × 4 bits, and 24× for 2 × 2 bits.

dsp,DSP-free 'coherent-lite' transceiver for next generation single wavelength optical intra-datacenter interconnects.,"We propose a DSP-free coherent-lite system that requires neither high-speed DSP nor high-resolution signal converters for deployment inside datacenters over single mode fiber links with reaches of 10 km and less. The removal of converters and DSP, in which some subsystems are fundamental for successful coherent detection, is enabled by either replacing DSP subsystems with optics having equivalent functions or by re-engineering the system. We validate in a proof-of-concept experiment the proposed DSP-free system using 50 Gbaud DP-16QAM delivering 400 Gb/s over 10 km of single mode fiber (SMF) below the KP4 forward error correction (FEC) threshold of 2.2 × 10-4. In addition, we perform a detailed experimental parametric study of the coherent-lite system in which various system parameters are swept such as baud rate, reach, laser power and laser linewidth. Our results verify that the coherent-lite system can be realized using low-cost DFB lasers with linewidths of a few hundred kHz. Moreover, we compare the performance of the coherent-lite system with that of a conventional coherent transceiver leveraging the full DSP stack. Then, we evaluate the power consumption savings achieved by the coherent-lite scheme relative to a classic DSP-based coherent system. Assuming a CMOS node ranging from 28 to 7 nm for DSP implementation, our estimate shows that the coherent-lite scheme can save 95 to 78% of the power consumed by the following subsystems: analog-to-digital converters, chromatic dispersion compensation, 2 × 2 MIMO polarization demultiplexing and carrier recovery. Finally, we compare the power consumption of the coherent-lite scheme with more standard 400G IM-DD systems utilizing either eight or four parallel WDM lanes (8 × 50G and 4 × 100G). The coherent-lite system is found to have similar module power consumption requirements as a corresponding 4 × 100G IM-DD system while bringing the benefits of coherent detection including improved sensitivity and higher spectral efficiency leading to fewer light sources per transceiver module. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first experimental demonstration of a DSP-free coherent-lite system for single channel 400G datacenter 10 km interconnects, a potential attractive solution due to its scalability to future 800G and 1.6T intra-datacenter optical interconnects.","M.

dsp,Embracing Diversity: Enhanced DSP Blocks for Low-Precision Deep Learning on FPGAs,"Use of reduced precisions in Deep Learning (DL) inference tasks has recently been shown to significantly improve accelerator performance and greatly reduce both model memory footprint and the required external memory bandwidth. With appropriate network retuning, reduced precision networks can achieve accuracy close or equal to that of full-precision floating-point models. Given the wide spectrum of precisions used in DL inference, FPGAs' ability to create custom bit-width datapaths gives them an advantage over other acceleration platforms in this domain. However, the embedded DSP blocks in the latest Intel and Xilinx FPGAs do not natively support precisions below 18-bit and thus can not efficiently pack low-precision multiplications, leaving the DSP blocks under-utilized. In this work, we present an enhanced DSP block that can efficiently pack 2× as many 9-bit and 4× as many 4-bit multiplications compared to the baseline Arria-10-like DSP block at the cost of 12% block area overhead which leads to only 0.6% total FPGA core area increase. We quantify the performance gains of using this enhanced DSP block in two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network accelerators on three different models: AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50. On average, the new DSP block enhanced the computational performance of the 8-bit and 4-bit accelerators by 1.32× and 1.6× and at the same time reduced the utilized chip area by 15% and 30% respectively.","Andrew Boutros, S.

dsp,"ML-DSP: Machine Learning with Digital Signal Processing for ultrafast, accurate, and scalable genome classification at all taxonomic levels","Although software tools abound for the comparison, analysis, identification, and classification of genomic sequences, taxonomic classification remains challenging due to the magnitude of the datasets and the intrinsic problems associated with classification. The need exists for an approach and software tool that addresses the limitations of existing alignment-based methods, as well as the challenges of recently proposed alignment-free methods. We propose a novel combination of supervised Machine Learning with Digital Signal Processing, resulting in ML-DSP: an alignment-free software tool for ultrafast, accurate, and scalable genome classification at all taxonomic levels. We test ML-DSP by classifying 7396 full mitochondrial genomes at various taxonomic levels, from kingdom to genus, with an average classification accuracy of >97%. A quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art classification software tools is performed, on two small benchmark datasets and one large 4322 vertebrate mtDNA genomes dataset. Our results show that ML-DSP overwhelmingly outperforms the alignment-based software MEGA7 (alignment with MUSCLE or CLUSTALW) in terms of processing time, while having comparable classification accuracies for small datasets and superior accuracies for the large dataset. Compared with the alignment-free software FFP (Feature Frequency Profile), ML-DSP has significantly better classification accuracy, and is overall faster. We also provide preliminary experiments indicating the potential of ML-DSP to be used for other datasets, by classifying 4271 complete dengue virus genomes into subtypes with 100% accuracy, and 4,710 bacterial genomes into phyla with 95.5% accuracy. Lastly, our analysis shows that the “Purine/Pyrimidine”, “Just-A” and “Real” numerical representations of DNA sequences outperform ten other such numerical representations used in the Digital Signal Processing literature for DNA classification purposes. Due to its superior classification accuracy, speed, and scalability to large datasets, ML-DSP is highly relevant in the classification of newly discovered organisms, in distinguishing genomic signatures and identifying their mechanistic determinants, and in evaluating genome integrity.","Gurjit S.

dsp,ERS Special Article. Reversing Mechanoinductive DSP Expression by CRISPR/dCas9‐mediated Epigenome Editing,"Rationale: DSP (desmoplakin), the most abundant component of desmosomes, which maintain the mechanical integrity of epithelium, is a genome‐wide association study‐identified genetic risk locus in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Subjects with IPF express a significantly higher level of DSP than control subjects. Objectives: Determine potential mechanisms by which DSP is regulated in lung fibrosis. Methods: Matrigel‐coated soft and stiff polyacrylamide gels were made to simulate the stiffness of normal and fibrotic lungs. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to evaluate transcription factor binding to the DSP promoter. Targeted DNA methylation was achieved by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR‐associated protein‐9 nuclease)‐mediated Dnmt3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A) expression under the guidance of sequence‐specific single guide RNAs. Measurements and Main Results: Stiff matrix promotes DSP gene expression in both human and rodent lung epithelial cells as compared with soft matrix. A conserved region in the proximal DSP promoter is hypermethylated under soft matrix conditions and becomes hypomethylated/demethylated under stiff matrix conditions. Demethylation of this conserved DSP promoter region is associated with transactivation of transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response protein 1), resulting in EGR1‐dependent DSP overexpression. Targeted DNA methylation by CRISPR/dCas9/Dnmt3A‐mediated epigenome editing blocks EGR1 binding to the DSP promoter and inhibits stiff matrix‐induced DSP overexpression. Conclusions: DSP is a matrix stiffness‐regulated mechanosensitive gene. CRISPR/dCas9‐Dnmt3A‐mediated epigenome editing reverses DSP overexpression by reestablishment of the epigenetic control of DSP under the mechanically homeostatic environment. It provides a useful tool for investigations of the functional role of DSP in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.","J. Qu, Lan-yan Zhu, Zijing Zhou, Ping Chen, Shuyan Liu, Morgan L. Locy, V.

dsp,The Dentin Sialoprotein (DSP) Domain Regulates Dental Mesenchymal Cell Differentiation through a Novel Surface Receptor,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is a dentin extracellular matrix protein that is processed into dentin sialoprotein (DSP), dentin glycoprotein (DGP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). DSP is mainly expressed in odontoblasts. We hypothesized that DSP interacts with cell surface receptors and subsequently activates intracellular signaling. Using DSP as bait for screening a protein library, we demonstrate that DSP acts as a ligand and binds to integrin β6. The 36 amino acid residues of DSP are sufficient to bind to integrin β6. This peptide promoted cell attachment, migration, differentiation and mineralization of dental mesenchymal cells. In addition, DSP aa183-219 stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38 kinases. This activation was inhibited by an anti-integrin β6 antibody and siRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this DSP fragment induces SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation via ERK1/2 and P38 signaling. SMAD1/5/8 binds to SMAD binding elements (SBEs) in the DSPP gene promoter. SBE mutations result in a decrease in DSPP transcriptional activity. Endogenous DSPP expression was up-regulated by DSP aa183-219 in dental mesenchymal cells. The data in the current study demonstrate for the first time that this DSP domain acts as a ligand in a RGD-independent manner and is involved in intracellular signaling via interacting with integrin β6.

dsp,Obfuscating DSP Circuits via High-Level Transformations,"This paper presents a novel approach to design obfuscated circuits for digital signal processing (DSP) applications using high-level transformations, a key-based obfuscating finite-state machine (FSM), and a reconfigurator. The goal is to design DSP circuits that are harder to reverse engineer. High-level transformations of iterative data-flow graphs have been exploited for area-speed-power tradeoffs. This is the first attempt to develop a design flow to apply high-level transformations that not only meet these tradeoffs but also simultaneously obfuscate the architectures both structurally and functionally. Several modes of operations are introduced for obfuscation where the outputs are meaningful from a signal processing point of view, but are functionally incorrect. Examples of such modes include a third-order digital filter that can also implement a sixth-order or ninth-order filter in a time-multiplexed manner. The latter two modes are meaningful but represent functionally incorrect modes. Multiple meaningful modes can be exploited to reconfigure the filter order for different applications. Other modes may correspond to nonmeaningful modes. A correct key input to an FSM activates a reconfigurator. The configure data controls various modes of the circuit operation. Functional obfuscation is accomplished by requiring use of the correct initialization key, and configure data. Wrong initialization key fails to enable the reconfigurator, and a wrong configure data activates either a meaningful but nonfunctional or nonmeaningful mode. Probability of activating the correct mode is significantly reduced leading to an obfuscated DSP circuit. Structural obfuscation is also achieved by the proposed methodology via high-level transformations. Experimental results show that the overhead of the proposed methodology is small, while a strong obfuscation is attained. For example, the area overhead for a (31)th-order IIR filter benchmark is only 17.7% with a 128-bit configuration key, where 1 ≤ l ≤ 8, i.e., the order of this filter should be a multiple of 3, and can vary from 3 to 24.","Yingjie Lao, K.

dsp,DSP complexity of mode-division multiplexed receivers.,"The complexities of common equalizer schemes are analytically analyzed in this paper in terms of complex multiplications per bit. Based on this approach we compare the complexity of mode-division multiplexed digital signal processing algorithms with different numbers of multiplexed modes in terms of modal dispersion and distance. It is found that training symbol based equalizers have significantly lower complexity compared to blind approaches for long-haul transmission. Among the training symbol based schemes, OFDM requires the lowest complexity for crosstalk compensation in a mode-division multiplexed receiver. The main challenge for training symbol based schemes is the additional overhead required to compensate modal crosstalk, which increases the data rate. In order to achieve 2000 km transmission, the effective modal dispersion must therefore be below 6 ps/km when the OFDM specific overhead is limited to 10%. It is concluded that for few mode transmission systems the reduction of modal delay is crucial to enable long-haul performance.","B. Inan, B. Spinnler, F. Ferreira, D. van den Borne, A. Lobato, S.

dsp,DSP-PP Precursor Protein Cleavage by Tolloid-Related-1 Protein and by Bone Morphogenetic Protein-1,"Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and phosphophoryn (PP), acidic proteins critical to dentin mineralization, are translated from a single transcript as a DSP-PP precursor that undergoes specific proteolytic processing to generate DSP and PP. The cleavage mechanism continues to be controversial, in part because of the difficulty of obtaining DSP-PP from mammalian cells and dentin matrix. We have infected Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus to produce large amounts of secreted DSP-PP240, a variant form of rat DSP-PP. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that DSP-PP240 secreted by Sf9 cells undergoes specific cleavage at the site predicted from the N-terminal sequence of PP extracted from dentin matrix: SMQG447↓D448DPN. DSP-PP240 is cleaved after secretion by a zinc-dependent activity secreted by Sf9 cells, generating DSP430 and PP240 products that are stable in the medium. DSP-PP processing activity is constitutively secreted by Sf9 cells, but secretion is diminished 3 days after infection. Using primers corresponding to the highly conserved catalytic domain of Drosophila melanogaster tolloid (a mammalian BMP1 homolog), we isolated a partial cDNA for a Spodopotera frugiperda tolloid-related-1 protein (TLR1) that is 78% identical to Drosophila TLR1 but only 65% identical to Drosophila tolloid. Tlr1 mRNA decreased rapidly in Sf9 cells after baculovirus infection and was undetectable 4d after infection, paralleling the observed decrease in secretion of the DSP-PP240 processing activity after infection. Human BMP1 is more similar to Sf9 and Drosophila TLR1 than to tolloid, and Sf9 TLR1 is more similar to BMP1 than to other mammalian homologs. Recombinant human BMP1 correctly processed baculovirus-expressed DSP-PP240 in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these data suggest that the physiologically accurate cleavage of mammalian DSP-PP240 in the Sf9 cell system represents the action of a conserved processing enzyme and support the proposed role of BMP1 in processing DSP-PP in dentin matrix.","H.

Each individual is a node in a complex network (or graph) of interdependencies and generates data, lots of data. We label the data by its source, or formally stated, we index the data by the nodes of the graph. The resulting signals (data indexed by the nodes) are far removed from time or image signals indexed by well ordered time samples or pixels. DSP, discrete signal processing, provides a comprehensive, elegant, and efficient methodology to describe, represent, transform, analyze, process, or synthesize these well ordered time or image signals.

dsp,A novel tool for arrhythmic risk stratification in desmoplakin gene variant carriers,"Abstract Background and Aims Pathogenic desmoplakin (DSP) gene variants are associated with the development of a distinct form of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy known as DSP cardiomyopathy. Patients harbouring these variants are at high risk for sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA), but existing tools for individualized arrhythmic risk assessment have proven unreliable in this population. Methods Patients from the multi-national DSP-ERADOS (Desmoplakin SPecific Effort for a RAre Disease Outcome Study) Network patient registry who had pathogenic or likely pathogenic DSP variants and no sustained VA prior to enrolment were followed longitudinally for the development of first sustained VA event. Clinically guided, step-wise Cox regression analysis was used to develop a novel clinical tool predicting the development of incident VA. Model performance was assessed by c-statistic in both the model development cohort (n = 385) and in an external validation cohort (n = 86). Results In total, 471 DSP patients [mean age 37.8 years, 65.6% women, 38.6% probands, 26% with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%] were followed for a median of 4.0 (interquartile range: 1.6–7.3) years; 71 experienced first sustained VA events {2.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 3.5] events/year}. Within the development cohort, five readily available clinical parameters were identified as independent predictors of VA and included in a novel DSP risk score: female sex [hazard ratio (HR) 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1–3.4)], history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia [HR 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1–2.8)], natural logarithm of 24-h premature ventricular contraction burden [HR 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1–1.4)], LVEF < 50% [HR 1.5 (95% CI: .95–2.5)], and presence of moderate to severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction [HR 6.0 (95% CI: 2.9–12.5)]. The model demonstrated good risk discrimination within both the development [c-statistic .782 (95% CI: .77–.80)] and external validation [c-statistic .791 (95% CI: .75–.83)] cohorts. The negative predictive value for DSP patients in the external validation cohort deemed to be at low risk for VA (<5% at 5 years; n = 26) was 100%. Conclusions The DSP risk score is a novel model that leverages readily available clinical parameters to provide individualized VA risk assessment for DSP patients.

fourier transform,Contributions of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in microplastic pollution research: A review,"Abstract Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been extensively used in microplastic (MP) pollution research since 2004. The aim of this review is to discuss and highlight the recent advances in FTIR (spectroscopy and chemical imaging) techniques that are used to characterize various polymer types of MPs and to trace their fate and transport in different environmental matrices. More than 400 research papers dealing with FTIR techniques in MP pollution research, which are published between January 2010 and December 2019, have been identified from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The MPs present in sediment, water (marine and freshwater), biota, air/dust, waste water treatment plants and salt are further classified according to (1) characterization and identification, (2) weathering and aging, (3) ecotoxicology, and (4) analytical methods. The results revealed that the ATR-FTIR technique is mostly used to identify and characterize the MPs found in water and sediment. The µFTIR (FTIR imaging) is extensively used to study the ingestion of MPs in biota (both marine and freshwater). In this article, we have summarized the current knowledge of application of FTIR spectroscopy to MP research and provided insights to future challenges for understanding the risk of MPs.

fourier transform,Peak Fitting Applied to Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman Spectroscopic Analysis of Proteins,"FTIR and Raman spectroscopy are often used to investigate the secondary structure of proteins. Focus is then often laid on the different features that can be distinguished in the Amide I band (1600–1700 cm−1) and, to a lesser extent, the Amide II band (1510–1580 cm−1), signature regions for C=O stretching/N-H bending, and N-H bending/C-N stretching vibrations, respectively. Proper investigation of all hidden and overlapping features/peaks is a necessary step to achieve reliable analysis of FTIR and FT-Raman spectra of proteins. This paper discusses a method to identify, separate, and quantify the hidden peaks in the amide I band region of infrared and Raman spectra of four globular proteins in aqueous solution as well as hydrated zein and gluten proteins. The globular proteins studied, which differ widely in terms of their secondary structures, include immunoglobulin G, concanavalin A, lysozyme, and trypsin. Peak finding was done by analysis of the second derivative of the original spectra. Peak separation and quantification was achieved by curve fitting using the Voigt function. Structural data derived from the FT-Raman and FTIR analyses were compared to literature reports on protein structure. This manuscript proposes an accurate method to analyze protein secondary structure based on the amide I band in vibrational spectra.","A. Sadat, I.

These results shed light on recent advances in computer vision and graphics that achieve state-of-the-art results by using MLPs to represent complex 3D objects and scenes. Using tools from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) literature, we show that a standard MLP fails to learn high frequencies both in theory and in practice. To overcome this spectral bias, we use a Fourier feature mapping to transform the effective NTK into a stationary kernel with a tunable bandwidth. We suggest an approach for selecting problem-specific Fourier features that greatly improves the performance of MLPs for low-dimensional regression tasks relevant to the computer vision and graphics communities.","Matthew Tancik, Pratul P.

fourier transform,Comparison of Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy for the Quantification of Microplastics in the Aquatic Environment.,"Microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) have been reported as emerging environmental contaminants, but reliable data are still lacking. We compared the two most promising techniques for MP analysis, namely, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, by analyzing MPs extracted from North Sea surface waters. Microplastics >500 μm were visually sorted and manually analyzed by μ-Raman and attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy. Microplastics ≤500 μm were concentrated on gold-coated filters and analyzed by automated single-particle exploration coupled to μ-Raman (ASPEx-μ-Raman) and FTIR imaging (reflection mode). The number of identified MPs >500 μm was slightly higher for μ-Raman (+23%) than ATR-FTIR analysis. Concerning MPs ≤500 μm, ASPEx-μ-Raman quantified two-times higher MP numbers but required a four-times higher analysis time compared to FTIR imaging. Because ASPEx-μ-Raman revealed far higher MP concentrations (38-2621 particles m-3) compared to the results of previous water studies (0-559 particles m-3), the environmental concentration of MPs ≤500 μm may have been underestimated until now. This may be attributed to the exceptional increase in concentration with decreasing MP size found in this work. Our results demonstrate the need for further research to enable time-efficient routine application of ASPEx-μ-Raman for reliable MP counting down to 1 μm.","Livia Cabernard, L. Roscher, C. Lorenz, G.

fourier transform,High-performance and scalable on-chip digital Fourier transform spectroscopy,"On-chip spectrometers have the potential to offer dramatic size, weight, and power advantages over conventional benchtop instruments for many applications such as spectroscopic sensing, optical network performance monitoring, hyperspectral imaging, and radio-frequency spectrum analysis. Existing on-chip spectrometer designs, however, are limited in spectral channel count and signal-to-noise ratio. Here we demonstrate a transformative on-chip digital Fourier transform spectrometer that acquires high-resolution spectra via time-domain modulation of a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The device, fabricated and packaged using industry-standard silicon photonics technology, claims the multiplex advantage to dramatically boost the signal-to-noise ratio and unprecedented scalability capable of addressing exponentially increasing numbers of spectral channels. We further explore and implement machine learning regularization techniques to spectrum reconstruction. Using an ‘elastic-D1’ regularized regression method that we develop, we achieved significant noise suppression for both broad (>600 GHz) and narrow (<25 GHz) spectral features, as well as spectral resolution enhancement beyond the classical Rayleigh criterion. On-chip spectrometers typically have limited spectral channels and low signal to noise ratios. Here the authors introduce a digital architecture that uses switches to change the interferometer path lengths, enabling exponentially more spectral channels per circuit element and lower noise by leveraging a machine learning reconstruction algorithm.","D.

fourier transform,Reviews of bearing vibration measurement using fast Fourier transform and enhanced fast Fourier transform algorithms,"The rolling element bearing is one of the most critical components in a machine. Vibration signals resulting from these bearings imply important bearing defect information related to the machinery faults. Any defect in a bearing may cause a certain vibration with specific frequencies and amplitudes depending on the nature of the defect. Therefore, the vibration analysis plays a key role for fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis to reach the reliability of the machines. Although fast Fourier transform for time–frequency analysis is still widely used in industry, it cannot extract enough frequencies without enough samples. If the real frequency does not match fast Fourier transform frequency grid exactly, the spectrum is spreading mostly among neighboring frequency bins. To resolve this drawback, the recent proposed enhanced fast Fourier transform algorithm was reported to improve this situation. This article reviews and compares both fast Fourier transform and enhanced fast Fourier transform for vibration signal analysis in both simulation and practical work. The comparative results verify that the enhanced fast Fourier transform can provide a better solution than traditional fast Fourier transform.","H.

fourier transform,Fourier-Transform Ghost Imaging with Hard X Rays.,"Knowledge gained through x-ray crystallography fostered structural determination of materials and greatly facilitated the development of modern science and technology in the past century. However, it is only applied to crystalline structures and cannot resolve noncrystalline materials. Here we demonstrate a novel lensless Fourier-transform ghost imaging method with pseudothermal hard x rays that extends x-ray crystallography to noncrystalline samples. By measuring the second-order intensity correlation function of the light, Fourier-transform diffraction pattern of a complex amplitude sample is achieved at the Fresnel region in our experiment and the amplitude and phase distributions of the sample in the spatial domain are retrieved successfully. For the first time, ghost imaging is experimentally realized with x rays. Since a highly coherent x-ray source is not required, the method can be implemented with laboratory x-ray sources and it also provides a potential solution for lensless diffraction imaging with fermions, such as neutrons and electrons where intensive coherent sources usually are not available.","Hong Yu, R.

fourier transform,Coded fourier transform,"We consider the problem of computing the Fourier transform of high-dimensional vectors, distributedly over a cluster of machines consisting of a master node and multiple worker nodes, where the worker nodes can only store and process a fraction of the inputs. We show that by exploiting the algebraic structure of the Fourier transform operation and leveraging concepts from coding theory, one can efficiently deal with the straggler effects. In particular, we propose a computation strategy, named as coded FFT, which achieves the optimal recovery threshold, defined as the minimum number of workers that the master node needs to wait for in order to compute the output. This is the first code that achieves the optimum robustness in terms of tolerating stragglers or failures for computing Fourier transforms. Furthermore, the reconstruction process for coded FFT can be mapped to MDS decoding, which can be solved efficiently. Moreover, we extend coded FFT to settings including computing general n-dimensional Fourier transforms, and provide the optimal computing strategy for those settings.","Qian Yu, M. Maddah-ali, A.

fourier transform,On the Graph Fourier Transform for Directed Graphs,"The analysis of signals defined over a graph is relevant in many applications, such as social and economic networks, big data or biological networks, and so on. A key tool for analyzing these signals is the so-called graph Fourier transform (GFT). Alternative definitions of GFT have been suggested in the literature, based on the eigen-decomposition of either the graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix. In this paper, we address the general case of directed graphs and we propose an alternative approach that builds the graph Fourier basis as the set of orthonormal vectors that minimize a continuous extension of the graph cut size, known as the Lovász extension. To cope with the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose two alternative iterative optimization methods, properly devised for handling orthogonality constraints. Finally, we extend the method to minimize a continuous relaxation of the  balanced cut size. The formulated problem is again nonconvex, and we propose an efficient solution method based on an explicit–implicit gradient algorithm.","S. Sardellitti, S. Barbarossa, P.

fourier transform,Applications of Micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in the Geological Sciences—A Review,"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can provide crucial information on the molecular structure of organic and inorganic components and has been used extensively for chemical characterization of geological samples in the past few decades. In this paper, recent applications of FTIR in the geological sciences are reviewed. Particularly, its use in the characterization of geochemistry and thermal maturation of organic matter in coal and shale is addressed. These investigations demonstrate that the employment of high-resolution micro-FTIR imaging enables visualization and mapping of the distributions of organic matter and minerals on a micrometer scale in geological samples, and promotes an advanced understanding of heterogeneity of organic rich coal and shale. Additionally, micro-FTIR is particularly suitable for in situ, non-destructive characterization of minute microfossils, small fluid and melt inclusions within crystals, and volatiles in glasses and minerals. This technique can also assist in the chemotaxonomic classification of macrofossils such as plant fossils. These features, barely accessible with other analytical techniques, may provide fundamental information on paleoclimate, depositional environment, and the evolution of geological (e.g., volcanic and magmatic) systems.","Yanyan Chen, C.

Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths, our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the “efficient Transformers” on the Long Range Arena benchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs).

fourier transform,FDA: Fourier Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"We describe a simple method for unsupervised domain adaptation, whereby the discrepancy between the source and target distributions is reduced by swapping the low-frequency spectrum of one with the other. We illustrate the method in semantic segmentation, where densely annotated images are aplenty in one domain (synthetic data), but difficult to obtain in another (real images). Current state-of-the-art methods are complex, some requiring adversarial optimization to render the backbone of a neural network invariant to the discrete domain selection variable. Our method does not require any training to perform the domain alignment, just a simple Fourier Transform and its inverse. Despite its simplicity, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the current benchmarks, when integrated into a relatively standard semantic segmentation model.

fourier transform,Simple and practical algorithm for sparse Fourier transform,"We consider the sparse Fourier transform problem: given a complex vector x of length n, and a parameter k, estimate the k largest (in magnitude) coefficients of the Fourier transform of x. The problem is of key interest in several areas, including signal processing, audio/image/video compression, and learning theory. 
 
We propose a new algorithm for this problem. The algorithm leverages techniques from digital signal processing, notably Gaussian and Dolph-Chebyshev filters. Unlike the typical approach to this problem, our algorithm is not iterative. That is, instead of estimating ""large"" coefficients, subtracting them and recursing on the reminder, it identifies and estimates the k largest coefficients in ""one shot"", in a manner akin to sketching/streaming algorithms. The resulting algorithm is structurally simpler than its predecessors. As a consequence, we are able to extend considerably the range of sparsity, k, for which the algorithm is faster than FFT, both in theory and practice.","Haitham Hassanieh, P. Indyk, D.

We show: An O(k log n)-time randomized algorithm for the case where the input signal has at most k non-zero Fourier coefficients, and An O(k log n log(n/k))-time randomized algorithm for general input signals.
 Both algorithms achieve o(n log n) time, and thus improve over the Fast Fourier Transform, for any k=o(n). They are the first known algorithms that satisfy this property. Also, if one assumes that the Fast Fourier Transform is optimal, the algorithm for the exactly k-sparse case is optimal for any k = nΩ(1).

fourier transform,"Information Transmission Using the Nonlinear Fourier Transform, Part I: Mathematical Tools","The nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT), a powerful tool in soliton theory and exactly solvable models, is a method for solving integrable partial differential equations governing wave propagation in certain nonlinear media. The NFT decorrelates signal degrees-of-freedom in such models, in much the same way that the Fourier transform does for linear systems. In this three-part series of papers, this observation is exploited for data transmission over integrable channels, such as optical fibers, where pulse propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. In this transmission scheme, which can be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing commonly used in linear channels, information is encoded in the nonlinear frequencies and their spectral amplitudes. Unlike most other fiber-optic transmission schemes, this technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or nonlinearity compensation methods. This paper explains the mathematical tools that underlie the method.","Mansoor I. Yousefi, F.

fourier transform,Faster GPS via the sparse fourier transform,"GPS is one of the most widely used wireless systems. A GPS receiver has to lock on the satellite signals to calculate its position. The process of locking on the satellites is quite costly and requires hundreds of millions of hardware multiplications, leading to high power consumption. The fastest known algorithm for this problem is based on the Fourier transform and has a complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of signal samples. This paper presents the fastest GPS locking algorithm to date. The algorithm reduces the locking complexity to O(n√(log n)). Further, if the SNR is above a threshold, the algorithm becomes linear, i.e., O(n). Our algorithm builds on recent developments in the growing area of sparse recovery. It exploits the sparse nature of the synchronization problem, where only the correct alignment between the received GPS signal and the satellite code causes their cross-correlation to spike.
 We further show that the theoretical gain translates into empirical gains for GPS receivers. Specifically, we built a prototype of the design using software radios and tested it on two GPS data sets collected in the US and Europe. The results show that the new algorithm reduces the median number of multiplications by 2.2x in comparison to the state of the art design, for real GPS signals.","Haitham Hassanieh, Fadel M. Adib, D.

fourier transform,Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection by Fractional Fourier Entropy,"Anomaly detection is an important task in hyperspectral remote sensing. Most widely used detectors, such as Reed–Xiaoli (RX), have been developed only using original spectral signatures, which may lack the capability of signal enhancement and noise suppression. In this article, an effective alternative approach, fractional Fourier entropy (FrFE)-based hyperspectral anomaly detection method, is proposed. First, fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is employed as preprocessing, which obtains features in an intermediate domain between the original reflectance spectrum and its Fourier transform with complementary strengths by space-frequency representations. It is desirable for noise removal so as to enhance the discrimination between anomalies and background. Furthermore, an FrFE-based step is developed to automatically determine an optimal fractional transform order. With a more flexible constraint, i.e., Shannon entropy uncertainty principle on FrFT, the proposed method can significantly distinguish signal from background and noise. Finally, the proposed FrFE-based anomaly detection method is implemented in the optimal fractional domain. Experimental results obtained on real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is quite competitive.","R. Tao, Xudong Zhao, Wei Li, Hengchao Li, Q.

Here we present a single-pixel imaging technique that can achieve high-quality images by acquiring their Fourier spectrum. We use phase-shifting sinusoid structured illumination for the spectrum acquisition. Applying inverse Fourier transform to the obtained spectrum yields the desired image. The proposed technique is capable of capturing a scene without a direct view of it. Thus, it enables a feasible placement of detectors, only if the detectors can collect the light signals from the scene. The technique is also a compressive sampling like approach, so it can reconstruct an image from sub-Nyquist measurements. We experimentally obtain clear images by utilizing a detector not placed in direct view of the imaged scene even with noise introduced by environmental illuminations. Single-pixel imaging can capture a scene without a direct line of sight to the object but high-quality imaging has proven challenging.

mimo,Massive MIMO for next generation wireless systems,"Multi-user MIMO offers big advantages over conventional point-to-point MIMO: it works with cheap single-antenna terminals, a rich scattering environment is not required, and resource allocation is simplified because every active terminal utilizes all of the time-frequency bins. However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned, with roughly equal numbers of service antennas and terminals and frequency-division duplex operation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as large-scale antenna systems, very large MIMO, hyper MIMO, full-dimension MIMO, and ARGOS) makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a large excess of service antennas over active terminals and time-division duplex operation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever smaller regions of space to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency. Other benefits of massive MIMO include extensive use of inexpensive low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the MAC layer, and robustness against intentional jamming. The anticipated throughput depends on the propagation environment providing asymptotically orthogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed any limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional research problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently need attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components that work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for newly joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided by the excess of service antennas, reducing internal power consumption to achieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment scenarios.

For example, the LTE standard allows for up to eight antenna ports at the base station. Basically, the more antennas the transmitter/receiver is equipped with, and the more degrees of freedom that the propagation channel can provide, the better the performance in terms of data rate or link reliability. More precisely, on a quasi static channel where a code word spans across only one time and frequency coherence interval, the reliability of a point-to-point MIMO link scales according to Prob(link outage) ` SNR-ntnr where nt and nr are the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively, and signal-to-noise ratio is denoted by SNR. On a channel that varies rapidly as a function of time and frequency, and where circumstances permit coding across many channel coherence intervals, the achievable rate scales as min(nt, nr) log(1 + SNR).

mimo,Cell-Free Massive MIMO Versus Small Cells,"A Cell-Free Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system comprises a very large number of distributed access points (APs), which simultaneously serve a much smaller number of users over the same time/frequency resources based on directly measured channel characteristics. The APs and users have only one antenna each. The APs acquire channel state information through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink pilot signals transmitted by the users. The APs perform multiplexing/de-multiplexing through conjugate beamforming on the downlink and matched filtering on the uplink. Closed-form expressions for individual user uplink and downlink throughputs lead to max–min power control algorithms. Max–min power control ensures uniformly good service throughout the area of coverage. A pilot assignment algorithm helps to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, but power control is far more important in that regard. Cell-Free Massive MIMO has considerably improved performance with respect to a conventional small-cell scheme, whereby each user is served by a dedicated AP, in terms of both 95%-likely per-user throughput and immunity to shadow fading spatial correlation. Under uncorrelated shadow fading conditions, the cell-free scheme provides nearly fivefold improvement in 95%-likely per-user throughput over the small-cell scheme, and tenfold improvement when shadow fading is correlated.","H.

mimo,Orbital-Angular-Momentum Embedded Massive MIMO: Achieving Multiplicative Spectrum-Efficiency for mmWave Communications,"By enabling very high bandwidth for radio communications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave), which can easily be integrated with massive-multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) due to small antenna size, has been attracting growing attention as a candidate for the fifth-generation (5G) and 5G-beyond wireless communications networks. On the other hand, the communication over the orthogonal states/modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a subset of the solutions offered by massive-MIMO communications. Traditional massive-MIMO-based mmWave communications did not concern the potential spectrum-efficiency-gain (SE-gain) offered by the orthogonal states of OAM. However, the highly expected maximum SE-gain for OAM and massive-MIMO communications is the product of SE-gains offered by OAM and multiplexing-MIMO. In this paper, we propose the OAM-embedded-MIMO (OEM) communication framework to obtain the multiplicative SE-gain for joint OAM and massive-MIMO-based mmWave wireless communications. We design the parabolic antenna for each uniform circular array antenna to converge OAM signals. Then, we develop the mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme to obtain the transmit signal on each OAM-mode of each transmit antenna. Also, we develop the OEM-water-filling power allocation policy to achieve the maximum multiplicative SE-gain for OEM communications. The extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate our developed a parabolic antenna-based converging method, a mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme, and an OEM-water-filling policy, showing that our proposed OEM mmWave communications can significantly increase the SE as compared with the traditional massive-MIMO-based mmWave communications.","Wenchi Cheng, Hailin Zhang, Liping Liang, Haiyue Jing, Zan Li",2024.0,80,IEEE Access,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea6e64716accac071a643c644cf6d0e200c7a37f,1.0,0.0006500893872907525,mimo orbitalangularmomentum embedded massive mimo achieving multiplicative spectrumefficiency for mmwave communications by enabling very high bandwidth for radio communications the millimeterwave mmwave which can easily be integrated with massivemultipleinputmultipleoutput massivemimo due to small antenna size has been attracting growing attention as a candidate for the fifthgeneration 5g and 5gbeyond wireless communications networks on the other hand the communication over the orthogonal statesmodes of orbital angular momentum oam is a subset of the solutions offered by massivemimo communications traditional massivemimobased mmwave communications did not concern the potential spectrumefficiencygain segain offered by the orthogonal states of oam however the highly expected maximum segain for oam and massivemimo communications is the product of segains offered by oam and multiplexingmimo in this paper we propose the oamembeddedmimo oem communication framework to obtain the multiplicative segain for joint oam and massivemimobased mmwave wireless communications we design the parabolic antenna for each uniform circular array antenna to converge oam signals then we develop the modedecomposition and multiplexingdetection scheme to obtain the transmit signal on each oammode of each transmit antenna also we develop the oemwaterfilling power allocation policy to achieve the maximum multiplicative segain for oem communications the extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate our developed a parabolic antennabased converging method a modedecomposition and multiplexingdetection scheme and an oemwaterfilling policy showing that our proposed oem mmwave communications can significantly increase the se as compared with the traditional massivemimobased mmwave communications wenchi cheng hailin zhang liping liang haiyue jing zan li

In particular, we introduce four XL-MIMO hardware architectures: uniform linear array (ULA)-based XL-MIMO, uniform planar array (UPA)-based XL-MIMO utilizing either patch antennas or point antennas, and continuous aperture (CAP)-based XL-MIMO. We comprehensively analyze and discuss their characteristics and interrelationships. Following this, we introduce several electromagnetic characteristics and general distance boundaries in XL-MIMO. Given the distinct electromagnetic properties of near-field communications, we present a range of channel models to demonstrate the benefits of XL-MIMO. We further discuss and summarize signal processing schemes for XL-MIMO. It is worth noting that the low-complexity signal processing schemes and deep learning empowered signal processing schemes are reviewed and highlighted to promote the practical implementation of XL-MIMO. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between XL-MIMO and other emergent 6G technologies.

Since the number of antennas is very large for ELAA, the electromagnetic radiation field needs to be modeled by near-field spherical waves, which differs from the conventional planar-wave-based radiation model of 5G massive MIMO. As a result, near-field MIMO communications will become essential in 6G wireless networks. In this article, we systematically investigate the emerging near-field communication techniques. First, we present the fundamentals of nearfield communications and the metric to determine the near-field ranges in typical communication scenarios. Then we investigate recent studies specific to near-field communications by classifying them into two categories: techniques addressing the challenges and those exploiting the potentials in near-field regions. Their principles, recent progress, pros, and cons are discussed. More importantly, several open problems and future research directions for near-field communications are pointed out.

mimo,A Tutorial on Near-Field XL-MIMO Communications Toward 6G,"Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks. By significantly boosting the antenna number or size to at least an order of magnitude beyond current massive MIMO systems, XL-MIMO is expected to unprecedentedly enhance the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution for wireless communication. The evolution from massive MIMO to XL-MIMO is not simply an increase in the array size, but faces new design challenges, in terms of near-field channel modeling, performance analysis, channel estimation, and practical implementation. In this article, we give a comprehensive tutorial overview on near-field XL-MIMO communications, aiming to provide useful guidance for tackling the above challenges. First, the basic near-field modeling for XL-MIMO is established, by considering the new characteristics of non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) and spatial non-stationarity.

Different from conventional MIMO systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the proposed system can flexibly change the positions of transmit/receive MAs, such that the MIMO channel between them is reconfigured to achieve higher capacity. We aim to characterize the capacity of MA-enabled point-to-point MIMO communication systems, by jointly optimizing the positions of transmit and receive MAs as well as the covariance of transmit signals. First, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the position of each transmit/receive MA with the other variables being fixed. Next, we propose alternative algorithms of lower complexity for capacity maximization in the low-SNR regime and for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) cases.

mimo,Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO: Far-Field or Near-Field?,"Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is promising to meet the high rate requirements for future 6G. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. Existing channel estimation algorithms with low pilot overhead heavily rely on the channel sparsity in the angular domain, which is achieved by the classical far-field planar-wavefront assumption. However, due to the non-negligible near-field spherical-wavefront property in XL-MIMO, this channel sparsity in the angular domain is not achievable. Therefore, existing far-field channel estimation schemes will suffer from severe performance loss. To address this problem, in this paper, we study the near-field channel estimation by exploiting the polar-domain sparsity. Specifically, unlike the classical angular-domain representation that only considers the angular information, we propose a polar-domain representation, which simultaneously accounts for both the angular and distance information. In this way, the near-field channel also exhibits sparsity in the polar domain, based on which, we propose on-grid and off-grid near-field XL-MIMO channel estimation schemes. Firstly, an on-grid polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (P-SOMP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently estimate the near-field channel. Furthermore, an off-grid polar-domain simultaneous iterative gridless weighted (P-SIGW) algorithm is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of our schemes.","Mingyao Cui, L.

mimo,Spatially Sparse Precoding in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems,"Millimeter wave (mmWave) signals experience orders-of-magnitude more pathloss than the microwave signals currently used in most wireless applications and all cellular systems. MmWave systems must therefore leverage large antenna arrays, made possible by the decrease in wavelength, to combat pathloss with beamforming gain. Beamforming with multiple data streams, known as precoding, can be used to further improve mmWave spectral efficiency. Both beamforming and precoding are done digitally at baseband in traditional multi-antenna systems. The high cost and power consumption of mixed-signal devices in mmWave systems, however, make analog processing in the RF domain more attractive. This hardware limitation restricts the feasible set of precoders and combiners that can be applied by practical mmWave transceivers. In this paper, we consider transmit precoding and receiver combining in mmWave systems with large antenna arrays. We exploit the spatial structure of mmWave channels to formulate the precoding/combining problem as a sparse reconstruction problem. Using the principle of basis pursuit, we develop algorithms that accurately approximate optimal unconstrained precoders and combiners such that they can be implemented in low-cost RF hardware. We present numerical results on the performance of the proposed algorithms and show that they allow mmWave systems to approach their unconstrained performance limits, even when transceiver hardware constraints are considered.","Omar El Ayach, S.

mimo,MIMO Broadcasting for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer,"Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising new solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks. In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long-range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound.","Rui Zhang, Chin Keong Ho",2011.0,2675,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b32334e574882a62c9c209987d2cbf524917ee8,0.8960000000000008,0.021737363887534538,mimo mimo broadcasting for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer wireless power transfer wpt is a promising new solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks in practice wpt is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling magnetic resonate coupling and electromagnetic em radiation for shortmidlongrange applications respectively in this paper we consider the em or radio signal enabled wpt in particular since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer swipt is pursued specifically this paper studies a multipleinput multipleoutput mimo wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas two scenarios are examined in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different mimo channels from the transmitter or colocated and see the identical mimo channel from the transmitter for the case of separated receivers we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer which are characterized by the boundary of a socalled rateenergy re region for the case of colocated receivers we show an outer bound for the achievable re region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly under this constraint we investigate two practical designs for the colocated receiver case namely time switching and power splitting and characterize their achievable re regions in comparison to the outer bound rui zhang chin keong ho

With the ever-increasing demands looming towards the sixth generation (6G), we are in need of additional degrees of freedom that deliver further gains beyond MIMO. To this goal, fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a new way to obtain spatial diversity using reconfigurable position-switchable antennas. Considering the case with more than one ports activated on a 2D fluid antenna surface at both ends, we take the information-theoretic approach to study the achievable performance limits of the MIMO-FAS. First of all, we propose a suboptimal scheme, referred to as QR MIMO-FAS, to maximize the rate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) via joint port selection, transmit and receive beamforming and power allocation. We then derive the optimal diversity and multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of MIMO-FAS. From the DMT, we highlight that MIMO-FAS outperforms traditional MIMO antenna systems. Further, we introduce a new metric, namely $q$ -outage capacity, which can jointly consider rate and outage probability.

mimo,Energy and Spectral Efficiency of Very Large Multiuser MIMO Systems,"A multiplicity of autonomous terminals simultaneously transmits data streams to a compact array of antennas. The array uses imperfect channel-state information derived from transmitted pilots to extract the individual data streams. The power radiated by the terminals can be made inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of base station antennas with no reduction in performance. In contrast if perfect channel-state information were available the power could be made inversely proportional to the number of antennas. Lower capacity bounds for maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection are derived. An MRC receiver normally performs worse than ZF and MMSE. However as power levels are reduced, the cross-talk introduced by the inferior maximum-ratio receiver eventually falls below the noise level and this simple receiver becomes a viable option. The tradeoff between the energy efficiency (as measured in bits/J) and spectral efficiency (as measured in bits/channel use/terminal) is quantified for a channel model that includes small-scale fading but not large-scale fading. It is shown that the use of moderately large antenna arrays can improve the spectral and energy efficiency with orders of magnitude compared to a single-antenna system.","H. Ngo, E. Larsson, T.

mimo,Foundations of User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO,"Imagine a coverage area where each mobile device is communicating with a preferred set of wireless access points (among many) that are selected based on its needs and cooperate to jointly serve it, instead of creating autonomous cells. This effectively leads to a user-centric post-cellular network architecture, which can resolve many of the interference issues and service-quality variations that appear in cellular networks. This concept is called User-centric Cell-free Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) and has its roots in the intersection between three technology components: Massive MIMO, coordinated multipoint processing, and ultra-dense networks. The main challenge is to achieve the benefits of cell-free operation in a practically feasible way, with computational complexity and fronthaul requirements that are scalable to enable massively large networks with many mobile devices. This monograph covers the foundations of User-centric Cell-free Massive MIMO, starting from the motivation and mathematical definition. It continues by describing the state-of-the-art signal processing algorithms for channel estimation, uplink data reception, and downlink data transmission with either centralized or distributed implementation. The achievable spectral efficiency is mathematically derived and evaluated numerically using a running example that exposes the impact of various system parameters and algorithmic choices. The fundamental tradeoffs between communication performance, computational complexity, and fronthaul signaling requirements are thoroughly analyzed.

mimo,Alternating Minimization Algorithms for Hybrid Precoding in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems,"Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications has been regarded as a key enabling technology for 5G networks, as it offers orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular bands. In contrast to conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, precoding in mmWave MIMO cannot be performed entirely at baseband using digital precoders, as only a limited number of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters can be supported considering their cost and power consumption. As a cost-effective alternative, a hybrid precoding transceiver architecture, combining a digital precoder and an analog precoder, has recently received considerable attention. However, the optimal design of such hybrid precoders has not been fully understood. In this paper, treating the hybrid precoder design as a matrix factorization problem, effective alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithms will be proposed for two different hybrid precoding structures, i.e., the fully-connected and partially-connected structures. In particular, for the fully-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm based on manifold optimization is proposed to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder, which, however, has a high complexity. Thus, a low-complexity AltMin algorithm is then proposed, by enforcing an orthogonal constraint on the digital precoder. Furthermore, for the partially-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm is also developed with the help of semidefinite relaxation. For practical implementation, the proposed AltMin algorithms are further extended to the broadband setting with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation. Simulation results will demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed AltMin algorithms over existing hybrid precoding algorithms. Moreover, based on the proposed algorithms, simulation comparisons between the two hybrid precoding structures will provide valuable design insights.","Xianghao Yu, Juei-Chin Shen, Jun Zhang, K.

By utilizing multiple antennas at both the transmitting and receiving ends, the MIMO system enhances the efficiency and performance of wireless communication systems. This manuscript specifies a comprehensive review of MIMO antenna design approaches for fifth generation (5G) and beyond. With an introductory glimpse of cellular generation and the frequency spectrum for 5G, profound key enabling technologies for 5G mobile communication are presented. A detailed analysis of MIMO performance parameters in terms of envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), total active reflection coefficient (TARC), mean effective gain (MEG), and isolation is presented along with the advantages of MIMO technology over conventional SISO systems. MIMO is characterized and the performance is compared based on wideband/ultra-wideband, multiband/reconfigurable, circular polarized wideband/circular polarized ultra-wideband/circular polarized multiband, and reconfigurable categories. The design approaches of MIMO antennas for various 5G bands are discussed. It is subsequently enriched with the detailed studies of wideband (WB)/ultra-wideband (UWB), multiband, and circular polarized MIMO antennas with different design techniques. A good MIMO antenna system should be well decoupled among different ports to enhance its performance, and hence isolation among different ports is a crucial factor in designing high-performance MIMO antennas. A summary of design approaches with improved isolation is presented.

mimo,"Flexible-Position MIMO for Wireless Communications: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Future Directions","The flexible-position multiple-input multiple-output (FLP-MIMO) - used in, for example, fluid antennas and movable antennas - is a promising technology for future wireless communications. This is due to the fact that the positions of antennas at the transceiver and reflector can be dynamically optimized using FLP-MIMO to achieve better channel conditions and, as such, can provide high spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) gains with fewer antennas. In this article, we introduce the fundamentals of FLP-MIMO systems, including hardware design, structure design, and potential applications. We shall demonstrate that FLP-MIMO, using fewer flexible antennas, can match the channel hardening achieved by a large number of fixed antennas. We will then analyze the SE-EE relationship for FLP-MIMO and fixed-position MIMO. Furthermore, we will design the optimal trajectory of flexible antennas to maximize system sum SE or total EE at a fixed travel distance of each antenna.

Such a cell-free network operation can potentially resolve many of the interference issues that appear in current cellular networks. This ambition was previously called Network MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) and has recently reappeared under the name Cell-Free Massive MIMO. The main challenge is to achieve the benefits of cell-free operation in a practically feasible way, with computational complexity and fronthaul requirements that are scalable to large networks with many users. We propose a new framework for scalable Cell-Free Massive MIMO systems by exploiting the dynamic cooperation cluster concept from the Network MIMO literature. We provide a novel algorithm for joint initial access, pilot assignment, and cluster formation that is proved to be scalable. Moreover, we adapt the standard channel estimation, precoding, and combining methods to become scalable.

mimo,Making Cell-Free Massive MIMO Competitive With MMSE Processing and Centralized Implementation,"Cell-free Massive MIMO is considered as a promising technology for satisfying the increasing number of users and high rate expectations in beyond-5G networks. The key idea is to let many distributed access points (APs) communicate with all users in the network, possibly by using joint coherent signal processing. The aim of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive analysis of this technology under different degrees of cooperation among the APs. Particularly, the uplink spectral efficiencies of four different cell-free implementations are analyzed, with spatially correlated fading and arbitrary linear processing. It turns out that it is possible to outperform conventional Cellular Massive MIMO and small cell networks by a wide margin, but only using global or local minimum mean-square error (MMSE) combining. This is in sharp contrast to the existing literature, which advocates for maximum-ratio combining. Also, we show that a centralized implementation with optimal MMSE processing not only maximizes the SE but largely reduces the fronthaul signaling compared to the standard distributed approach. This makes it the preferred way to operate Cell-free Massive MIMO networks. Non-linear decoding is also investigated and shown to bring negligible improvements.","Emil Björnson, L.

This new era brings challenging demands to the network, such as high spectral efficiency, low-latency, high-reliable communication, and high energy efficiency. One of the major technological breakthroughs to cope with these unprecedented demands is the cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. In CF mMIMO, a large number of distributed access points are connected to a central processing unit, and serve a smaller number of users over the same time-frequency resources. The system has shown a great potential in improving the network performance in various perspectives compared to the co-located mMIMO and conventional small-cell systems. Furthermore, the system can be flexibly integrated with various emerging techniques/technologies for 5G and beyond networks to boost the network performance in different perspectives. Despite the substantial reported theoretical gains of CF mMIMO systems, the full picture of a practical scalable deployment of the system is not clear yet. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of different aspects of the CF mMIMO system from the general system model, the detailed system operation, the limitations towards a practically implemented system to the potential of integrating the system with emerging techniques/technologies.

mimo,Massive MIMO Transmission for LEO Satellite Communications,"Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications are expected to be incorporated in future wireless networks, in particular 5G and beyond networks, to provide global wireless access with enhanced data rates. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, though widely used in terrestrial communication systems, have not been applied to LEO satellite communication systems. In this paper, we propose a massive MIMO transmission scheme with full frequency reuse (FFR) for LEO satellite communication systems and exploit statistical channel state information (sCSI) to address the difficulty of obtaining instantaneous CSI (iCSI) at the transmitter. We first establish the massive MIMO channel model for LEO satellite communications and simplify the transmission designs via performing Doppler and delay compensations at user terminals (UTs). Then, we develop the low-complexity sCSI based downlink (DL) precoder and uplink (UL) receiver in closed-form, aiming to maximize the average signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ASLNR) and the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR), respectively. It is shown that the DL ASLNRs and UL ASINRs of all UTs reach their upper bounds under some channel condition. Motivated by this, we propose a space angle based user grouping (SAUG) algorithm to schedule the served UTs into different groups, where each group of UTs use the same time and frequency resource. The proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the lower and upper bounds of the achievable rate coincide when the number of satellite antennas or UT groups is sufficiently large. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed massive MIMO transmission scheme with FFR significantly enhances the data rate of LEO satellite communication systems. Notably, the proposed sCSI based precoder and receiver achieve the similar performance with the iCSI based ones that are often infeasible in practice.","Li You, Ke-Xin Li, Jiaheng Wang, Xiqi Gao, X.

mimo,Joint Transmit Beamforming for Multiuser MIMO Communications and MIMO Radar,"Future wireless communication systems are expected to explore spectral bands typically used by radar systems, in order to overcome spectrum congestion of traditional communication bands. Since in many applications radar and communication share the same platform, spectrum sharing can be facilitated by joint design as a dual-function radar-communications system. In this paper, we propose a joint transmit beamforming model for a dual-function multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar and multiuser MIMO communication transmitter. The proposed dual-function system transmits the weighted sum of independent radar waveforms and communication symbols, forming multiple beams towards the radar targets and the communication receivers, respectively. The design of the weighting coefficients is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is the performance of the MIMO radar transmit beamforming, while guaranteeing that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each communication user is higher than a given threshold. Despite the non-convexity of the proposed optimization problem, we prove that it can be relaxed into a convex one, where the relaxation is tight. We then propose a reduced complexity design based on zero-forcing the inter-user interference and radar interference. Unlike previous works, which focused on the transmission of communication symbols to synthesize a radar transmit beam pattern, our method provides more degrees of freedom for MIMO radar and is thus able to obtain improved radar performance, as demonstrated in our simulation study. Furthermore, the proposed dual-function scheme approaches the radar performance of the radar-only scheme, i.e., without spectrum sharing, under reasonable communication quality constraints.","Xiang Liu, Tianyao Huang, Yimin Liu, Jie Zhou",2019.0,735,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/821e4c255f237f8b881dfdb5f1bf7cc4ee26dae2,0.9600000000000009,0.005972696245733789,mimo joint transmit beamforming for multiuser mimo communications and mimo radar future wireless communication systems are expected to explore spectral bands typically used by radar systems in order to overcome spectrum congestion of traditional communication bands since in many applications radar and communication share the same platform spectrum sharing can be facilitated by joint design as a dualfunction radarcommunications system in this paper we propose a joint transmit beamforming model for a dualfunction multipleinputmultipleoutput mimo radar and multiuser mimo communication transmitter the proposed dualfunction system transmits the weighted sum of independent radar waveforms and communication symbols forming multiple beams towards the radar targets and the communication receivers respectively the design of the weighting coefficients is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is the performance of the mimo radar transmit beamforming while guaranteeing that the signaltointerferenceplusnoise ratio sinr at each communication user is higher than a given threshold despite the nonconvexity of the proposed optimization problem we prove that it can be relaxed into a convex one where the relaxation is tight we then propose a reduced complexity design based on zeroforcing the interuser interference and radar interference unlike previous works which focused on the transmission of communication symbols to synthesize a radar transmit beam pattern our method provides more degrees of freedom for mimo radar and is thus able to obtain improved radar performance as demonstrated in our simulation study furthermore the proposed dualfunction scheme approaches the radar performance of the radaronly scheme ie without spectrum sharing under reasonable communication quality constraints xiang liu tianyao huang yimin liu jie zhou

mimo,Delay-Phase Precoding for Wideband THz Massive MIMO,"Benefiting from tens of GHz of bandwidth, terahertz (THz) communication has become a promising technology for future 6G network. To deal with the serious propagation loss of THz signals, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with hybrid precoding is utilized to generate directional beams with high array gains. However, the standard hybrid precoding architecture based on frequency-independent phase-shifters cannot cope with the beam split effect in THz massive MIMO caused by the large bandwidth and the large number of antennas, where the beams split into different physical directions at different frequencies. The beam split effect will result in a serious array gain loss across the entire bandwidth, which has not been well investigated in THz massive MIMO. In this paper, we first quantify the seriousness of the beam split effect in THz massive MIMO by analyzing the array gain loss it causes. Then, we propose a new precoding architecture called delay-phase precoding (DPP) to mitigate this effect. Specifically, the proposed DPP introduces a time delay network composed of a small number of time delay elements between radio-frequency chains and phase-shifters in the standard hybrid precoding architecture. Unlike frequency-independent phase shifts, the time delay network introduced in the DPP can realize frequency-dependent phase shifts, which can be designed to generate frequency-dependent beams towards the target physical direction across the entire bandwidth. Due to the joint control of delay and phase, the proposed DPP can alleviate the array gain loss caused by the beam split effect. Furthermore, we propose a hardware structure by using true-time-delayers to realize frequency-dependent phase shifts for realizing the concept of DPP. A corresponding precoding algorithm is proposed to realize the precoding design. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the proposed DPP can mitigate the beam split effect and achieve near-optimal rate with higher energy efficiency.","L. Dai, Jingbo Tan, Zhi Chen, H.

mimo,Capacity Characterization for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided MIMO Communication,"Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution to enhance the wireless communication capacity both cost-effectively and energy-efficiently, by properly altering the signal propagation via tuning a large number of passive reflecting units. In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in general, by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and the MIMO transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices are optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients is designed to cater to all the subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes.

mimo,DeepMIMO: A Generic Deep Learning Dataset for Millimeter Wave and Massive MIMO Applications,"Machine learning tools are finding interesting applications in millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO systems. This is mainly thanks to their powerful capabilities in learning unknown models and tackling hard optimization problems. To advance the machine learning research in mmWave/massive MIMO, however, there is a need for a common dataset. This dataset can be used to evaluate the developed algorithms, reproduce the results, set benchmarks, and compare the different solutions. In this work, we introduce the DeepMIMO dataset, which is a generic dataset for mmWave/massive MIMO channels. The DeepMIMO dataset generation framework has two important features. First, the DeepMIMO channels are constructed based on accurate ray-tracing data obtained from Remcom Wireless InSite. The DeepMIMO channels, therefore, capture the dependence on the environment geometry/materials and transmitter/receiver locations, which is essential for several machine learning applications. Second, the DeepMIMO dataset is generic/parameterized as the researcher can adjust a set of system and channel parameters to tailor the generated DeepMIMO dataset for the target machine learning application. The DeepMIMO dataset can then be completely defined by the (i) the adopted ray-tracing scenario and (ii) the set of parameters, which enables the accurate definition and reproduction of the dataset. In this paper, an example DeepMIMO dataset is described based on an outdoor ray-tracing scenario of 18 base stations and more than one million users.

mimo,Adaptive Fixed-Time Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Asymmetric Output Constraints Using Universal Barrier Functions,"In this note, we propose a novel adaptive fixed-time control scheme for output tracking problems of a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with asymmetric output constraint requirements, using a new universal barrier function. It is universal in the sense that the proposed scheme is a general one that also works for systems with symmetric constraints or without constraint requirements, without changing the control structure. Novel adaptive estimations and analysis are introduced to address system uncertainties in the fixed-time convergence settings. We show that under the proposed novel control scheme, each element in the system output tracking error vector of the MIMO nonlinear system can converge into small sets near zero with fixed-time convergence rate, while the asymmetric output constraint requirements on each element of the output tracking error are satisfied at all time. The proposed scheme can effectively deal with unmatched system uncertainties and uncertain gain functions.

mimo,Multicell MIMO Communications Relying on Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces,"Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) constitute a disruptive wireless communication technique capable of creating a controllable propagation environment. In this paper, we propose to invoke an IRS at the cell boundary of multiple cells to assist the downlink transmission to cell-edge users, whilst mitigating the inter-cell interference, which is a crucial issue in multicell communication systems. We aim for maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users through jointly optimizing the active precoding matrices at the base stations (BSs) and the phase shifts at the IRS subject to each BS’s power constraint and unit modulus constraint. Both the BSs and the users are equipped with multiple antennas, which enhances the spectral efficiency by exploiting the spatial multiplexing gain. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we first reformulate it into an equivalent one, which is solved by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, where the precoding matrices and phase shifts are alternately optimized. The optimal precoding matrices can be obtained in closed form, when fixing the phase shifts. A pair of efficient algorithms are proposed for solving the phase shift optimization problem, namely the Majorization-Minimization (MM) Algorithm and the Complex Circle Manifold (CCM) Method. Both algorithms are guaranteed to converge to at least locally optimal solutions. We also extend the proposed algorithms to the more general multiple-IRS and network MIMO scenarios.

We derive an exact channel gain expression that captures three essential near-field behaviors and use it to revisit the power scaling laws.

We further prove that an IRS-aided setup cannot achieve a higher SNR than an equal-sized Massive MIMO setup, despite its faster SNR growth.

mimo,Generalized Transceiver Beamforming for DFRC With MIMO Radar and MU-MIMO Communication,"Spatial beamforming is an efficient way to realize dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC). In this paper, we study the DFRC design for a general scenario, where the dual-functional base station (BS) simultaneously detects the target as a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar while communicating with multiple multi-antenna communication users (CUs). This necessitates a joint transceiver beamforming design for both MIMO radar and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) communication. In order to characterize the performance tradeoff between MIMO radar and MU-MIMO communication, we first define the achievable performance region of the DFRC system. Then, both radar-centric and communication-centric optimizations are formulated to achieve the boundary of the performance region. For the radar-centric optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA) method is adopted to solve the non-convex constraint. For the communication-centric optimization, a solution based on weighted mean square error (MSE) criterion is obtained to solve the non-convex objective function. Furthermore, two low-complexity beamforming designs based on CU-selection and zero-forcing are proposed to avoid iteration, and the closed-form expressions of the low-complexity beamforming designs are derived.

However, along with their ability to significantly increase channel capacity, it is a challenge to achieve an optimal isolation in a compact size for fifth-generation (5G) terminals. Portable devices, automobiles, handheld gadgets, smart phones, wireless sensors, radio frequency identification and other applications use MIMO antenna systems. In this review paper, the fundamentals of MIMO antennas, the performance parameters of MIMO antennas, and different design approaches and methodologies are discussed to realize the three most commonly used MIMO antennas, i.e., ultra-wideband (UWB), dual-band and circularly polarized antennas. The recent MIMO antenna design approaches with UWB, dual band and circularly polarized characteristics are compared in terms of their isolation techniques, gain, efficiency, envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and channel capacity loss (CCL). This paper is very helpful to design suitable MIMO antennas applicable in UWB systems, satellite communication systems, GSM, Bluetooth, WiMAX, WLAN and many more. The issues with MIMO antenna systems in the indoor environment along with possible solutions to improve their performance are discussed.

However, the fundamental limitations of the existing hybrid precoding schemes are that they have high-computational complexity and fail to fully exploit the spatial information. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a deep-learning-enabled mmWave massive MIMO framework for effective hybrid precoding, in which each selection of the precoders for obtaining the optimized decoder is regarded as a mapping relation in the deep neural network (DNN). Specifically, the hybrid precoder is selected through training based on the DNN for optimizing precoding process of the mmWave massive MIMO. Additionally, we present extensive simulation results to validate the excellent performance of the proposed scheme. The results exhibit that the DNN-based approach is capable of minimizing the bit error ratio and enhancing the spectrum efficiency of the mmWave massive MIMO, which achieves better performance in hybrid precoding compared with conventional schemes while substantially reducing the required computational complexity.","Hongji Huang, Yiwei Song, Jie Yang, Guan Gui, F.

mimo,Near-Field Channel Estimation in Mixed LoS/NLoS Environments for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems,"Accurate channel model and channel estimation are essential to empower extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) in 6G networks with ultra-high spectral efficiency. With the sharp increase in the antenna array aperture of the XL-MIMO scenario, the electromagnetic propagation field will change from far-field to near-field. Unfortunately, due to the near-field effect, most of the existing XL-MIMO channel models fail to describe mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path components simultaneously. In this paper, a mixed LoS/NLoS near-field XL-MIMO channel model is proposed to match the practical near-field XL-MIMO scenario, where the LoS path component is modeled by the geometric free space propagation assumption while NLoS path components are modeled by the near-field array response vectors. Then, to define the range of near-field for XL-MIMO, the MIMO Rayleigh distance (MIMO-RD) and MIMO advanced RD (MIMO-ARD) is derived. Next, a two stage channel estimation algorithm is proposed, where the LoS path component and NLoS path components are estimated separately. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed algorithm is derived in this paper. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed two stage scheme is able to outperform the existing methods in both the theoretical channel model and the QuaDRiGa channel emulation platform.","Yu Lu, L.

This is the concept of Holographic MIMO communications. Accurate and tractable channel modeling is critical to understanding its full potential. Classical stochastic models used by communications theorists are derived under the electromagnetic far-field assumption, i.e. planar wave approximation over the array. However, such assumption breaks down when electromagnetically large (compared to the wavelength) antenna arrays are considered - as envisioned in future wireless communications. In this paper, we start from the first principles of wave propagation and provide a Fourier plane-wave series expansion of the channel response, which fully captures the essence of electromagnetic propagation in arbitrary scattering and is also valid in the (radiative) near-field. The expansion is based on the Fourier spectral representation and has an intuitive physical interpretation, as it statistically describes the angular coupling between source and receiver. When discretized uniformly, it leads to a low-rank semi-unitarily equivalent approximation of the spatial electromagnetic channel in the angular domain. The developed channel model is used to compute the ergodic capacity of a point-to-point Holographic MIMO system with different degrees of channel state information.","Andrea Pizzo, L. Sanguinetti, T.

However, the fundamental challenge of existing massive MIMO systems is that high computational complexity and complicated spatial structures bring great difficulties to exploit the characteristics of the channel and sparsity of these multi-antennas systems. To address this problem, in this paper, we focus on channel estimation and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, and a novel framework that integrates the massive MIMO into deep learning is proposed. To realize end-to-end performance, a deep neural network (DNN) is employed to conduct offline learning and online learning procedures, which is effective to learn the statistics of the wireless channel and the spatial structures in the angle domain. Concretely, the DNN is first trained by simulated data in different channel conditions with the aids of the offline learning, and then corresponding output data can be obtained based on current input data during online learning process. In order to realize super-resolution channel estimation and DOA estimation, two algorithms based on the deep learning are developed, in which the DOA can be estimated in the angle domain without additional complexity directly.

mimo,Ubiquitous cell-free Massive MIMO communications,"Since the first cellular networks were trialled in the 1970s, we have witnessed an incredible wireless revolution. From 1G to 4G, the massive traffic growth has been managed by a combination of wider bandwidths, refined radio interfaces, and network densification, namely increasing the number of antennas per site. Due its cost-efficiency, the latter has contributed the most. Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key 5G technology that uses massive antenna arrays to provide a very high beamforming gain and spatially multiplexing of users and hence increases the spectral and energy efficiency (see references herein). It constitutes a centralized solution to densify a network, and its performance is limited by the inter-cell interference inherent in its cell-centric design. Conversely, ubiquitous cell-free Massive MIMO refers to a distributed Massive MIMO system implementing coherent user-centric transmission to overcome the inter-cell interference limitation in cellular networks and provide additional macro-diversity. These features, combined with the system scalability inherent in the Massive MIMO design, distinguish ubiquitous cell-free Massive MIMO from prior coordinated distributed wireless systems. In this article, we investigate the enormous potential of this promising technology while addressing practical deployment issues to deal with the increased back/front-hauling overhead deriving from the signal co-processing.","Giovanni Interdonato, Emil Björnson, Hien Quoc Ngo, P.

mimo,Joint Communication and Sensing Toward 6G: Models and Potential of Using MIMO,"The sixth-generation (6G) network is envisioned to integrate communication and sensing functions, so as to improve the spectrum efficiency and support explosive novel applications. Although the similarities of wireless communication and radio sensing lay the foundation for their combination, there is still considerable incompatible interest between them. To simultaneously guarantee the communication capacity and the sensing accuracy, the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technique plays an important role due to its unique capability of spatial beamforming and waveform shaping. However, the configuration of MIMO also brings high hardware cost, high power consumption, and high signal processing complexity. How to efficiently apply MIMO to achieve balanced communication and sensing performance is still open. In this survey, we discuss joint communication and sensing (JCAS) in the context of MIMO. We first outline the roles of MIMO in the process of wireless communication and radar sensing. Then, we present current advances in both communication and sensing coexistence and integration in detail. Three novel JCAS MIMO models are subsequently discussed by combining cutting-edge technologies, i.e., cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Examined from the practical perspective, the potential and challenges of MIMO in JCAS are summarized, and promising solutions are provided. Motivated by the great potential of the Internet of Things (IoT), we also specify JCAS in IoT scenarios and discuss the uniqueness of applying JCAS to IoT. In the end, open issues are outlined to envisage a ubiquitous, intelligent, and secure JCAS network in the near future.","Xinran Fang, W.

mimo,MU-MIMO Communications With MIMO Radar: From Co-Existence to Joint Transmission,"Beamforming techniques are proposed for a joint multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) radar-communication (RadCom) system, where a single device acts as radar and a communication base station (BS) by simultaneously communicating with downlink users and detecting radar targets. Two operational options are considered, where we first split the antennas into two groups, one for radar and the other for communication. Under this deployment, the radar signal is designed to fall into the null-space of the downlink channel. The communication beamformer is optimized such that the beampattern obtained matches the radar’s beampattern while satisfying the communication performance requirements. To reduce the optimizations’ constraints, we consider a second operational option, where all the antennas transmit a joint waveform that is shared by both radar and communications. In this case, we formulate an appropriate probing beampattern, while guaranteeing the performance of the downlink communications. By incorporating the SINR constraints into objective functions as penalty terms, we further simplify the original beamforming designs to weighted optimizations, and solve them by efficient manifold algorithms. Numerical results show that the shared deployment outperforms the separated case significantly, and the proposed weighted optimizations achieve a similar performance to the original optimizations, despite their significantly lower computational complexity.","Fan Liu, C.

The proposed MIMO configuration consists of a two antenna arrays combination. Each antenna array consists of four elements which are arranged in an even manner, while two arrays are then assembled with a 90-degree shift with respect to each other. The substrate used is a 0.254 mm thick Rogers RT5880 with a dielectric constant of 2.2 and loss tangent of 0.0009, correspondingly. The proposed MIMO antenna array covers the 37 GHz frequency band, dedicated for 5G millimeter-wave communication applications. The proposed antenna element yields a gain of 6.84 dB, which is enhanced up to 12.8 dB by adopting a four elements array configuration. The proposed MIMO antenna array performance metrics, such as envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and diversity gain (DG), are observed, which are found to be under the standard threshold. More than 85% of the radiation efficiency of the proposed MIMO antenna array is observed to be within the desired operating frequency band.

However, existing far-field or near-field channel model mismatches the hybrid-field channel feature in the practical XL-MIMO system. Thus, existing far-field and near-field channel estimation schemes cannot be directly used to accurately estimate the hybrid-field XL-MIMO channel. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient hybrid-field channel estimation scheme by accurately modeling the XL-MIMO channel. Specifically, we firstly reveal the hybrid-field channel feature of the XL-MIMO channel, where different scatters may be in far-field or near-field region. Then, we propose a hybrid-field channel model to capture this feature, which contains both the far-field and near-field path components. Finally, we propose a hybrid-field channel estimation scheme, where the far-field and near-field path components are respectively estimated.

Although with tens of gigahertz available bandwidth, THz signals suffer from severe free-spreading loss and molecular-absorption loss, which limit the wireless transmission distance. To compensate for the propagation loss, the ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output (UM-MIMO) can be applied to generate a high-gain directional beam by beamforming technologies. In this paper, a review of beamforming technologies for THz UM-MIMO systems is provided.

mimo,Beyond Massive MIMO: The Potential of Data Transmission With Large Intelligent Surfaces,"In this paper, we consider the potential of data transmission in a system with a massive number of radiating and sensing elements, thought of as a contiguous surface of electromagnetically active material. We refer to this as a large intelligent surface (LIS), which is a newly proposed concept and conceptually goes beyond contemporary massive MIMO technology. First, we consider capacities of single-antenna autonomous terminals communicating to the LIS where the entire surface is used as a receiving antenna array in a perfect line-of-sight propagation environment. Under the condition that the surface area is sufficiently large, the received signal after a matched-filtering operation can be closely approximated by a sinc-function-like intersymbol interference channel. Second, we analyze a normalized capacity measured per unit surface, for a fixed transmit power per volume unit with different terminal deployments. As terminal density increases, the limit of the normalized capacity [nats/s/Hz/volume-unit] achieved when wavelength <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lambda$</tex-math></inline-formula> approaches zero is equal to half of the transmit power per volume unit divided by the noise spatial power spectral density.

mimo,On the Total Energy Efficiency of Cell-Free Massive MIMO,"We consider the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink, where a very large number of distributed multiple-antenna access points (APs) serve many single-antenna users in the same time-frequency resource. A simple (distributed) conjugate beamforming scheme is applied at each AP via the use of local channel state information (CSI). This CSI is acquired through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink training signals transmitted by the users. We derive a closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency taking into account the effects of channel estimation errors and power control. This closed-form result enables us to analyze the effects of backhaul power consumption, the number of APs, and the number of antennas per AP on the total energy efficiency, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation algorithm. The optimal power allocation algorithm aims at maximizing the total energy efficiency, subject to a per-user spectral efficiency constraint and a per-AP power constraint. Compared with the equal power control, our proposed power allocation scheme can double the total energy efficiency. Furthermore, we propose AP selections schemes, in which each user chooses a subset of APs, to reduce the power consumption caused by the backhaul links. With our proposed AP selection schemes, the total energy efficiency increases significantly, especially for large numbers of APs.

The perceptible novelty of the proposed MIMO system is its wide operating bandwidth, high gain, lower interelement gap, and excellent isolation within the MIMO components. The radiating patch of the antenna is truncated diagonally with a partially ground plane, and a metasurface has been employed for enhancing the antenna performance. The suggested MS integrated single antenna prototype has a miniature dimension of 0.58λ × 0.58λ × 0.02λ. The simulated and measured findings demonstrate a wideband characteristic starting from 3.11 to 7.67 GHz including a high realized gain of 8 dBi. The four-element MIMO system has been designed by rendering each single antenna orthogonally to one another while retaining compact size and wideband properties between 3.2 and 7.6 GHz. The suggested MIMO prototype has been designed and fabricated on a low loss Rogers RT5880 substrate with a miniature dimension of 1.05λ × 1.05λ × 0.02λ and its performance is evaluated using a suggested 10 × 10 array of a square enclosed circular split ring resonators within the same substrate material. The inclusion of the proposed metasurface with a backplane significantly reduces antenna backward radiation and manipulates the electromagnetic field, thus improving the bandwidth, gain and isolation of MIMO components. The suggested 4-port MIMO antenna offers a high realized gain of 8.3 dBi compared to existing MIMO antennas with an excellent average total efficiency of 82% in the 5G sub-6 GHz spectrum and is in good accordance with measured results. Furthermore, the developed MIMO antenna exhibits outstanding diversity characteristics in respect of envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) less than 0.004, diversity gain (DG) close to 10 dB (> 9.98 dB) and high isolation between MIMO components (> 15.5 dB).

We provide a taxonomy in terms of the required channel state information (CSI), namely whether the processing adapts to the instantaneous or the average (second-order) CSI; while the former provides somewhat better signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SNIR), the latter has much lower overhead for CSI acquisition.

mimo,Energy-Efficient Hybrid Analog and Digital Precoding for MmWave MIMO Systems With Large Antenna Arrays,"Millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO will likely use hybrid analog and digital precoding, which uses a small number of RF chains to reduce the energy consumption associated with mixed signal components like analog-to-digital components not to mention baseband processing complexity. However, most hybrid precoding techniques consider a fully connected architecture requiring a large number of phase shifters, which is also energy-intensive. In this paper, we focus on the more energy-efficient hybrid precoding with subconnected architecture, and propose a successive interference cancelation (SIC)-based hybrid precoding with near-optimal performance and low complexity. Inspired by the idea of SIC for multiuser signal detection, we first propose to decompose the total achievable rate optimization problem with nonconvex constraints into a series of simple subrate optimization problems, each of which only considers one subantenna array. Then, we prove that maximizing the achievable subrate of each subantenna array is equivalent to simply seeking a precoding vector sufficiently close (in terms of Euclidean distance) to the unconstrained optimal solution. Finally, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to realize SIC-based hybrid precoding, which can avoid the need for the singular value decomposition (SVD) and matrix inversion. Complexity evaluation shows that the complexity of SIC-based hybrid precoding is only about 10% as complex as that of the recently proposed spatially sparse precoding in typical mmWave MIMO systems. Simulation results verify that SIC-based hybrid precoding is near-optimal and enjoys higher energy efficiency than the spatially sparse precoding and the fully digital precoding.","Xinyu Gao, L.

mimo,"Toward Massive MIMO 2.0: Understanding Spatial Correlation, Interference Suppression, and Pilot Contamination","Since the seminal paper by Marzetta from 2010, Massive MIMO has changed from being a theoretical concept with an infinite number of antennas to a practical technology. The key concepts are adopted into the 5G New Radio Standard and base stations (BSs) with $M=64$ fully digital transceivers have been commercially deployed in sub-6GHz bands. The fast progress was enabled by many solid research contributions of which the vast majority assume spatially uncorrelated channels and signal processing schemes developed for single-cell operation. These assumptions make the performance analysis and optimization of Massive MIMO tractable but have three major caveats: 1) practical channels are spatially correlated; 2) large performance gains can be obtained by multicell processing, without BS cooperation; 3) the interference caused by pilot contamination creates a finite capacity limit, as $M\to \infty $ . There is a thin line of papers that avoided these caveats, but the results are easily missed. Hence, this tutorial article explains the importance of considering spatial channel correlation and using signal processing schemes designed for multicell networks. We present recent results on the fundamental limits of Massive MIMO, which are not determined by pilot contamination but the ability to acquire channel statistics. These results will guide the journey towards the next level of Massive MIMO, which we call “Massive MIMO 2.0”.","L. Sanguinetti, Emil Björnson, J.

mimo,Massive MIMO: ten myths and one critical question,"Wireless communications is one of the most successful technologies in modern years, given that an exponential growth rate in wireless traffic has been sustained for over a century (known as Cooper's law). This trend will certainly continue, driven by new innovative applications; for example, augmented reality and the Internet of Things. Massive MIMO has been identified as a key technology to handle orders of magnitude more data traffic. Despite the attention it is receiving from the communication community, we have personally witnessed that Massive MIMO is subject to several widespread misunderstandings, as epitomized by following (fictional) abstract: “The Massive MIMO technology uses a nearly infinite number of high-quality antennas at the base stations. By having at least an order of magnitude more antennas than active terminals, one can exploit asymptotic behaviors that some special kinds of wireless channels have. This technology looks great at first sight, but unfortunately the signal processing complexity is off the charts and the antenna arrays would be so huge that it can only be implemented in millimeter-wave bands.” These statements are, in fact, completely false. In this overview article, we identify 10 myths and explain why they are not true. We also ask a question that is critical for the practical adoption of the technology and which will require intense future research activities to answer properly.

mimo,Study on Mutual Coupling Reduction Technique for MIMO Antennas,"In recent years, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antennas with the ability to radiate waves in more than one pattern and polarization play a great role in modern telecommunication systems. This paper provides a theoretical review of different mutual coupling reduction techniques in MIMO antenna systems. The increase in the mutual coupling can affect the antenna characteristics drastically and therefore degrades the performance of the MIMO systems. It is possible to improve the performance partially by calibrating the mutual coupling in the digital domain.

mimo,Overview of Precoding Techniques for Massive MIMO,"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is playing a crucial role in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) communication systems. Unfortunately, the complexity of massive MIMO systems is tremendously increased when a large number of antennas and radio frequency chains (RF) are utilized. Therefore, a plethora of research efforts has been conducted to find the optimal precoding algorithm with lowest complexity. The main aim of this paper is to provide insights on such precoding algorithms to a generalist of wireless communications. The added value of this paper is that the classification of massive MIMO precoding algorithms is provided with easily distinguishable classes of precoding solutions. This paper covers linear precoding algorithms starting with precoders based on approximate matrix inversion methods such as the truncated polynomial expansion (TPE), the Neumann series approximation (NSA), the Newton iteration (NI), and the Chebyshev iteration (CI) algorithms. The paper also presents the fixed-point iteration-based linear precoding algorithms such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) algorithm, the successive over relaxation (SOR) algorithm, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and the Jacobi iteration (JI) algorithm. In addition, the paper reviews the direct matrix decomposition based linear precoding algorithms such as the QR decomposition and Cholesky decomposition (CD). The non-linear precoders are also presented which include the dirty-paper coding (DPC), Tomlinson-Harashima (TH), vector perturbation (VP), and lattice reduction aided (LR) algorithms. Due to the necessity to deal with a high consuming power by the base station (BS) with a large number of antennas in massive MIMO systems, a special subsection is included to describe the characteristics of the peak-to-average power ratio precoding (PAPR) algorithms such as the constant envelope (CE) algorithm, approximate message passing (AMP), and quantized precoding (QP) algorithms. This paper also reviews the machine learning role in precoding techniques. Although many precoding techniques are essentially proposed for a small-scale MIMO, they have been exploited in massive MIMO networks. Therefore, this paper presents the application of small-scale MIMO precoding techniques for massive MIMO. This paper demonstrates the precoding schemes in promising multiple antenna technologies such as the cell-free massive MIMO (CF-M-MIMO), beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In-depth discussion on the pros and cons, performance-complexity profile, and implementation solidity is provided. This paper also provides a discussion on the channel estimation and energy efficiency. This paper also presents potential future directions in massive MIMO precoding algorithms.","M. Albreem, A. A.

mimo,Non-Stationarities in Extra-Large-Scale Massive MIMO,"Massive MIMO, a key technology for increasing area spectral efficiency in cellular systems, was developed assuming moderately sized apertures. In this article, we argue that massive MIMO systems behave differently in large-scale regimes due to spatial non-stationarity. In the large-scale regime, with arrays of around 50 wavelengths, the terminals see the whole array but non-stationarities occur because different regions of the array see different propagation paths. At even larger dimensions, which we call the extra-large scale regime, terminals see a portion of the array and inside the first type of non-stationarities might occur. We show that the non-stationarity properties of the massive MIMO channel change several important MIMO design aspects. In simulations, we demonstrate how non-stationarity is a curse when neglected but a blessing when embraced in terms of computational load and multi-user transceiver design.","E.

A key shortcoming for present-day vehicular radar imaging is poor azimuth resolution (for side-looking operation) due to the form factor limits on antenna size and placement. In this paper, we propose a solution via a new multiple-input and multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) imaging technique, that applies coherent SAR principles to vehicular MIMO radar to improve the side-view (angular) resolution. The proposed 2-stage hierarchical MIMO-SAR processing workflow drastically reduces the computation load while preserving image resolution. To enable coherent processing over the synthetic aperture, we integrate a radar odometry algorithm that estimates the trajectory of ego-radar.

In this paper, we focus on one of the fundamental challenges, namely the channel acquisition, in a RIS-assisted multiuser MIMO system. The state-of-the-art channel acquisition approach in such a system with fully passive RIS elements estimates the cascaded transmitter-to-RIS and RIS-to-receiver channels by adopting excessively long training sequences. To estimate the cascaded channels with an affordable training overhead, we formulate the channel estimation problem in the RIS-assisted multiuser MIMO system as a matrix-calibration based matrix factorization task. By exploiting the information on the slow-varying channel components and the hidden channel sparsity, we propose a novel message-passing based algorithm to factorize the cascaded channels. Furthermore, we present an analytical framework to characterize the theoretical performance bound of the proposed estimator in the large-system limit. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","Hang Liu, Xiaojun Yuan, Y.

mimo,ScatterMIMO: enabling virtual MIMO with smart surfaces,"In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone.","Manideep Dunna, Chi Zhang, D.

However, the feedback becomes expensive with the growing complexity of CSI in massive MIMO system. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches are used to improve the reconstruction efficiency of CSI feedback. In this paper, a novel feedback network named CRNet is proposed to achieve better performance via extracting CSI features on multiple resolutions. An advanced training scheme that further boosts the network performance is also introduced.

First, the linearized PMSHM mathematical model is obtained by voltage feedforward compensation. Second, to acquire satisfactory dynamics of speed response and zero d-axis current, the discretized state-space model of the PMSHM is augmented with the integral of rotor speed error and integral of d-axis current error. Then, the GWO algorithm is employed to acquire the weighting matrices Q and R in linear quadratic regulator optimization process. Moreover, a penalty term is introduced to the fitness index to suppress overshoots effectively.

In the design procedure, the universal approximation capability of radial basis function neural networks is used for identifying the unknown compounded nonlinear functions, and a variable separation technique is employed to overcome the design difficulty caused by the nonstrict-feedback structure. The most outstanding novelty of this paper is that individual Lyapunov function of each subsystem is constructed by flexibly adopting the upper and lower bounds of the control gain functions of each subsystem. Furthermore, by combining the average dwell-time scheme and the adaptive backstepping design, a valid adaptive neural state-feedback controller design algorithm is presented such that all the signals of the switched closed-loop system are in probability semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in probability.

state feedback,Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback,"Like humans, large language models (LLMs) do not always generate the best output on their first try. Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance.

state feedback,Fixed-Parameter Damping Methods of Virtual Synchronous Generator Control Using State Feedback,"Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is a promising control method for grid-tied inverters, as it can provide inertia support for the grid. However, VSG-controlled grid-tied inverters are subjected to intrinsic low-frequency oscillation, because the emulation of swing equation of a conventional synchronous generator (SG) also introduces an oscillatory mode. In this paper, a damping term produced from state feedback control is added to VSG control to solve this issue. This method is then further developed by applying a low pass filter to the measured active power, to improve its ripple attenuation ability, at the cost of increased design complexity. Both the proposed state feedback damping method without and with low pass filter have one more design degree of freedom than previous methods, which is used to improve dynamic response to active power reference change. The small-signal analyses and experimental results show that both methods can well damp the intrinsic low-frequency oscillation with better dynamic responses than previous fixed-parameter damping methods, whereas the method with a low pass filter has the best overall performance thanks to its improved ripple attenuation ability.","Jia Liu, Y.

NNs are used to approximate the unknown internal dynamics, and an adaptive NN state observer is developed to estimate the immeasurable states. By constructing a barrier type of optimal cost functions for subsystems and employing an observer and the actor-critic architecture, the virtual and actual optimal controllers are developed under the framework of backstepping technique. In addition to ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals, the proposed strategy can also guarantee that system states are confined within some preselected compact sets all the time. This is achieved by means of barrier Lyapunov functions which have been successfully applied to various kinds of nonlinear systems such as strict-feedback and pure-feedback dynamics. Besides, our developed optimal controller requires less conditions on system dynamics than some existing approaches concerning optimal control.

state feedback,Linear State-Feedback Primary Control for Enhanced Dynamic Response of AC Microgrids,"This paper proposes a state feedback primary control strategy for microgrids with multiple distributed energy resource units, improving their transient behavior in both islanded and grid-connected modes of operation. To that end, the interaction of each distributed energy resource unit within the microgrid is modeled as a lumped dynamic system, which results to be nonlinear and multivariable. For the closed-loop control of such multivariable systems, the full state feedback formulation is preferred which requires a suitable state observer. For the design of the observer and feedback gains, the solution of the linear-quadratic estimation and regulation problems is considered. For simplicity, an approximate linear model at a representative operating point is derived. The linear quadratic Gaussian/loop-transfer recovery is adopted as the design procedure to optimize the trajectory of the state variables subject to a desirable actuation effort, in this case of the voltage amplitude and frequency, yielding a solution that is robust to model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the strategy is assessed through time-domain simulation on the CIGRE benchmark medium-voltage distribution network with three distributed energy resource units. These results are compared to those obtained with conventional static droop gains and with a state-of-the-art technique from the literature.","Ricardo Pérez-Ibacache, César A. Silva, A.

state feedback,Learning the optimal state-feedback via supervised imitation learning,"Imitation learning is a control design paradigm that seeks to learn a control policy reproducing demonstrations from expert agents. By substituting expert demonstrations for optimal behaviours, the same paradigm leads to the design of control policies closely approximating the optimal state-feedback. This approach requires training a machine learning algorithm (in our case deep neural networks) directly on state-control pairs originating from optimal trajectories. We have shown in previous work that, when restricted to low-dimensional state and control spaces, this approach is very successful in several deterministic, non-linear problems in continuous-time. In this work, we refine our previous studies using as a test case a simple quadcopter model with quadratic and time-optimal objective functions. We describe in detail the best learning pipeline we have developed, that is able to approximate via deep neural networks the state-feedback map to a very high accuracy. We introduce the use of the softplus activation function in the hidden units of neural networks showing that it results in a smoother control profile whilst retaining the benefits of rectifiers. We show how to evaluate the optimality of the trained state-feedback, and find that already with two layers the objective function reached and its optimal value differ by less than one percent.

state feedback,Adaptive Fuzzy Full-State and Output-Feedback Control for Uncertain Robots With Output Constraint,"This article focuses on the tracking control issue of robotic systems with dynamic uncertainties. To enhance tracking accuracy in a robotic manipulator with uncertainties, an adaptive fuzzy full-state feedback control is proposed. In view of output-feedback control with unknown states, a high-gain observer is employed to estimate unknown states. Considering the particular requirement that output of systems should be constrained in some practical working fields, we further design adaptive fuzzy full-state and output-feedback control schemes with output constraint to ensure that output maintains in constrained regions. By applying the Lyapunov theory, it is guaranteed that closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Tangent-type barrier Lyapunov function is used for the controller design with output constraint and ensure stability. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed methods is shown through both simulation examples and experimental results, comparative experiments in Baxter robot are proposed for evaluating the practicability of our proposed methods in actual applications.","Xinbo Yu, Wei He, Hongyi Li, Jian Sun",2021.0,203,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17a460528dbcdf8db65b21fb58c1413993901db1,0.9759999999999991,0.0016496018202502845,state feedback adaptive fuzzy fullstate and outputfeedback control for uncertain robots with output constraint this article focuses on the tracking control issue of robotic systems with dynamic uncertainties to enhance tracking accuracy in a robotic manipulator with uncertainties an adaptive fuzzy fullstate feedback control is proposed in view of outputfeedback control with unknown states a highgain observer is employed to estimate unknown states considering the particular requirement that output of systems should be constrained in some practical working fields we further design adaptive fuzzy fullstate and outputfeedback control schemes with output constraint to ensure that output maintains in constrained regions by applying the lyapunov theory it is guaranteed that closedloop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded sguub tangenttype barrier lyapunov function is used for the controller design with output constraint and ensure stability finally the effectiveness of our proposed methods is shown through both simulation examples and experimental results comparative experiments in baxter robot are proposed for evaluating the practicability of our proposed methods in actual applications xinbo yu wei he hongyi li jian sun

state feedback,Removing the Feasibility Conditions Imposed on Tracking Control Designs for State-Constrained Strict-Feedback Systems,"For strict-feedback nonlinear systems under full-state constraints, current barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and integral BLF based control solutions rely on feasibility conditions for virtual controllers. In this work, we present a new solution that completely removes such restrictive conditions. First, we construct a nonlinear state-dependent function that purely depends on constrained states to cope with full state and asymmetric constraints directly; second, we introduce a new coordinate transformation and integrate it into each step of dynamic surface control based backstepping design, completely circumventing the demanding feasibility conditions on virtual controllers. Consequently, there is no need for the tedious offline computations for feasibility verification, allowing the designer more freedom to select design parameters, enabling the system with a larger range of initial conditions to be handled, and rendering the solution more user-friendly in design and implementation. Simulation verification also confirms the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed control method.","Kai Zhao, Yongduan Song",2019.0,387,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b6cd4899ebac80e296d9ac728350675d8d55f03,0.9600000000000009,0.003144807411019015,state feedback removing the feasibility conditions imposed on tracking control designs for stateconstrained strictfeedback systems for strictfeedback nonlinear systems under fullstate constraints current barrier lyapunov function blf and integral blf based control solutions rely on feasibility conditions for virtual controllers in this work we present a new solution that completely removes such restrictive conditions first we construct a nonlinear statedependent function that purely depends on constrained states to cope with full state and asymmetric constraints directly second we introduce a new coordinate transformation and integrate it into each step of dynamic surface control based backstepping design completely circumventing the demanding feasibility conditions on virtual controllers consequently there is no need for the tedious offline computations for feasibility verification allowing the designer more freedom to select design parameters enabling the system with a larger range of initial conditions to be handled and rendering the solution more userfriendly in design and implementation simulation verification also confirms the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed control method kai zhao yongduan song

A new fairly comprehensive system model, semi-Markov jump system with singular perturbations, which is more general than Markov jump model, is employed to describe the phenomena of random abrupt changes in structure and parameters of the systems. Based on a slow state variables feedback control scheme, a novel technique to design the desired controller is presented and the allowed maximum of singular perturbation parameter can be calculated. With the help of the discrete-time semi-Markov kernel approach, some sojourn-time-dependent and less-conservative sufficient conditions are established via a novel matrix decoupling technique to ensure the solvability of the problem to be addressed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the superiority and usefulness of the proposed method.","Hao Shen, Feng Li, Shengyuan Xu, V.

The pure-feedback systems of this paper are assumed to possess nonlinear function uncertainties. By using the mean value theorem, pure-feedback systems can be transformed into strict feedback forms. For the newly generated systems, NNs are employed to approximate unknown items. Based on the adaptive control scheme and backstepping algorithm, an intelligent controller is designed. At the same time, time-varying Barrier Lyapunov functions ( BLFs ) with error variables are adopted to avoid violating full state constraints in every step of the backstepping design. All closedloop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the output tracking error converges to the neighborhood of zero, which can be verified by using the Lyapunov stability theorem.

state feedback,Feedback regulation of steady-state epithelial turnover and organ size,"Epithelial organs undergo steady-state turnover throughout adult life, with old cells being continually replaced by the progeny of stem cell divisions. To avoid hyperplasia or atrophy, organ turnover demands strict equilibration of cell production and loss. However, the mechanistic basis of this equilibrium is unknown. Here we show that robustly precise turnover of the adult Drosophila intestine arises through a coupling mechanism in which enterocyte apoptosis breaks feedback inhibition of stem cell division. Healthy enterocytes inhibit stem cell division through E-cadherin, which prevents secretion of mitogenic epidermal growth factors (EGFs) by repressing transcription of the EGF maturation factor rhomboid. Individual apoptotic enterocytes promote divisions by loss of E-cadherin, which releases cadherin-associated β-catenin (Armadillo in Drosophila) and p120-catenin to induce rhomboid. Induction of rhomboid in the dying enterocyte triggers activation of the EGF receptor (Egfr) in stem cells within a discrete radius. When we blocked apoptosis, E-cadherin-controlled feedback suppressed divisions, and the organ retained the same number of cells. When we disrupted feedback, apoptosis and divisions were uncoupled, and the organ developed either hyperplasia or atrophy. Together, our results show that robust cellular balance hinges on the obligate coupling of divisions to apoptosis, which limits the proliferative potential of a stem cell to the precise time and place at which a replacement cell is needed. In this way, localized cell–cell communication gives rise to tissue-level homeostatic equilibrium and constant organ size.","Jackson Liang, S. Balachandra, Sang M Ngo, L. E.

state feedback,BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback,"Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products). In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive k-nearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.","Steffen Rendle, Christoph Freudenthaler, Zeno Gantner, L.

state feedback,Overview of Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback in Massive MIMO Systems,"Many performance gains achieved by massive multiple-input and multiple-output depend on the accuracy of the downlink channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (base station), which is usually obtained by estimating at the receiver (user equipment) and feeding back to the transmitter. The overhead of CSI feedback occupies substantial uplink bandwidth resources, especially when the number of transmit antennas is large. Deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback refers to CSI compression and reconstruction by a DL-based autoencoder and can greatly reduce feedback overhead. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research on this topic is provided, beginning with basic DL concepts widely used in CSI feedback and then categorizing and describing some existing DL-based feedback works. The focus is on novel neural network architectures and utilization of communication expert knowledge to improve CSI feedback accuracy. Works on joint design of CSI feedback with other communication modules are also introduced, and some practical issues, including bitstream generation, multirate feedback, imperfect feedback, NN complexity, training dataset collection, online training, and standardization effect, are discussed. At the end of the paper, some challenges and potential research directions associated with DL-based CSI feedback in future wireless communication systems are identified.","Jiajia Guo, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin, Geoffrey Y.

A fuzzy state observer is designed via fuzzy-logic systems, thus the unmeasurable states are estimated based on the designed fuzzy state observer. By constructing the logarithm Lyapunov functions and incorporating the property of the fuzzy basis functions and bounded control design technique into the adaptive backstepping recursive design, a novel observer-based adaptive fuzzy output-feedback control method is developed. The proposed fuzzy adaptive output-feedback backstepping control scheme can remove the restrictive assumptions in the previous literature that the virtual control gains and actual control gain functions must be constants. Furthermore, it can make the control system be semiglobally uniformly ultimately boundedness (SGUUB) and keep the observer and tracking errors to remain in a small neighborhood of the origin.

However, most of them have suffered from the boundary challenge. The state-of-the-art methods employ feature aggregation tech- nique and can precisely find out wherein the salient object, but they often fail to segment out the entire object with fine boundaries, especially those raised narrow stripes. So there is still a large room for improvement over the FCN based models. In this paper, we design the Attentive Feedback Modules (AFMs) to better explore the structure of objects. A Boundary-Enhanced Loss (BEL) is further employed for learning exquisite boundaries.

state feedback,Speech Production as State Feedback Control,"Spoken language exists because of a remarkable neural process. Inside a speaker's brain, an intended message gives rise to neural signals activating the muscles of the vocal tract. The process is remarkable because these muscles are activated in just the right way that the vocal tract produces sounds a listener understands as the intended message. What is the best approach to understanding the neural substrate of this crucial motor control process? One of the key recent modeling developments in neuroscience has been the use of state feedback control (SFC) theory to explain the role of the CNS in motor control. SFC postulates that the CNS controls motor output by (1) estimating the current dynamic state of the thing (e.g., arm) being controlled, and (2) generating controls based on this estimated state. SFC has successfully predicted a great range of non-speech motor phenomena, but as yet has not received attention in the speech motor control community. Here, we review some of the key characteristics of speech motor control and what they say about the role of the CNS in the process.

state feedback,Dynamic Model Pruning with Feedback,"Deep neural networks often have millions of parameters. This can hinder their deployment to low-end devices, not only due to high memory requirements but also because of increased latency at inference. We propose a novel model compression method that generates a sparse trained model without additional overhead: by allowing (i) dynamic allocation of the sparsity pattern and (ii) incorporating feedback signal to reactivate prematurely pruned weights we obtain a performant sparse model in one single training pass (retraining is not needed, but can further improve the performance). We evaluate the method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and show that the obtained sparse models can reach the state-of-the-art performance of dense models and further that their performance surpasses all previously proposed pruning schemes (that come without feedback mechanisms).","Tao Lin, Sebastian U.

Feedforward architectures can learn rich representations of the input space but do not explicitly model dependencies in the output spaces, that are quite structured for tasks such as articulated human pose estimation or object segmentation. Here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, we use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process we call Iterative Error Feedback (IEF). IEF shows excellent performance on the task of articulated pose estimation in the challenging MPII and LSP benchmarks, matching the state-of-the-art without requiring ground truth scale annotation.","João Carreira, Pulkit Agrawal, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Jitendra Malik",2015.0,771,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66d4475f0eee4b65983e06b1fbafad533eb81b2a,0.9280000000000008,0.0062652364700146275,state feedback human pose estimation with iterative error feedback hierarchical feature extractors such as convolutional networks convnets have achieved impressive performance on a variety of classification tasks using purely feedforward processing feedforward architectures can learn rich representations of the input space but do not explicitly model dependencies in the output spaces that are quite structured for tasks such as articulated human pose estimation or object segmentation here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces by introducing topdown feedback instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go we use a selfcorrecting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions in a process we call iterative error feedback ief ief shows excellent performance on the task of articulated pose estimation in the challenging mpii and lsp benchmarks matching the stateoftheart without requiring ground truth scale annotation joão carreira pulkit agrawal katerina fragkiadaki jitendra malik

However, the huge number of antennas poses a challenge to the conventional CSI feedback reduction methods and leads to excessive feedback overhead. In this letter, we develop a real-time CSI feedback architecture, called CsiNet-long short-term memory (LSTM), by extending a novel deep learning (DL)-based CSI sensing and recovery network. CsiNet-LSTM considerably enhances recovery quality and improves tradeoff between compression ratio (CR) and complexity by directly learning spatial structures combined with time correlation from training samples of time-varying massive MIMO channels. Simulation results demonstrate that CsiNet-LSTM outperforms existing compressive sensing-based and DL-based methods and is remarkably robust to CR reduction.","Tianqi Wang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin, Geoffrey Y.

state feedback,Feedback Control of AHR Signaling Regulates Intestinal Immunity,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) recognizes xenobiotics as well as natural compounds such as tryptophan metabolites, dietary components and microbiota-derived factors, and it is important for maintenance of homeostasis at mucosal surfaces. AHR activation induces cytochrome P4501 (CYP1) enzymes, which oxygenate AHR ligands, leading to their metabolic clearance and detoxification. Thus, CYP1 enzymes have an important feedback role that curtails the duration of AHR signalling, but it remains unclear whether they also regulate AHR ligand availability in vivo. Here we show that dysregulated expression of Cyp1a1 in mice depletes the reservoir of natural AHR ligands, generating a quasi AHR-deficient state. Constitutive expression of Cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted specifically to intestinal epithelial cells resulted in loss of AHR-dependent type 3 innate lymphoid cells and T helper 17 cells and increased susceptibility to enteric infection. The deleterious effects of excessive AHR ligand degradation on intestinal immune functions could be counter-balanced by increasing the intake of AHR ligands in the diet. Thus, our data indicate that intestinal epithelial cells serve as gatekeepers for the supply of AHR ligands to the host and emphasize the importance of feedback control in modulating AHR pathway activation.","Chris Schiering, E.

state feedback,Reinforcement Learning-Based Linear Quadratic Regulation of Continuous-Time Systems Using Dynamic Output Feedback,"In this paper, we propose a model-free solution to the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of continuous-time systems based on reinforcement learning using dynamic output feedback. The design objective is to learn the optimal control parameters by using only the measurable input–output data, without requiring model information. A state parametrization scheme is presented which reconstructs the system state based on the filtered input and output signals. Based on this parametrization, two new output feedback adaptive dynamic programming Bellman equations are derived for the LQR problem based on policy iteration and value iteration (VI). Unlike the existing output feedback methods for continuous-time systems, the need to apply discrete approximation is obviated. In contrast with the static output feedback controllers, the proposed method can also handle systems that are state feedback stabilizable but not static output feedback stabilizable. An advantage of this scheme is that it stands immune to the exploration bias issue. Moreover, it does not require a discounted cost function and, thus, ensures the closed-loop stability and the optimality of the solution. Compared with earlier output feedback results, the proposed VI method does not require an initially stabilizing policy. We show that the estimates of the control parameters converge to those obtained by solving the LQR algebraic Riccati equation. A comprehensive simulation study is carried out to verify the proposed algorithms.","Syed Ali Asad Rizvi, Zongli Lin",2020.0,99,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3aacc37da1c67c790e2c3fac156030cf5007da3,0.968,0.0008044856167723063,state feedback reinforcement learningbased linear quadratic regulation of continuoustime systems using dynamic output feedback in this paper we propose a modelfree solution to the linear quadratic regulation lqr problem of continuoustime systems based on reinforcement learning using dynamic output feedback the design objective is to learn the optimal control parameters by using only the measurable inputoutput data without requiring model information a state parametrization scheme is presented which reconstructs the system state based on the filtered input and output signals based on this parametrization two new output feedback adaptive dynamic programming bellman equations are derived for the lqr problem based on policy iteration and value iteration vi unlike the existing output feedback methods for continuoustime systems the need to apply discrete approximation is obviated in contrast with the static output feedback controllers the proposed method can also handle systems that are state feedback stabilizable but not static output feedback stabilizable an advantage of this scheme is that it stands immune to the exploration bias issue moreover it does not require a discounted cost function and thus ensures the closedloop stability and the optimality of the solution compared with earlier output feedback results the proposed vi method does not require an initially stabilizing policy we show that the estimates of the control parameters converge to those obtained by solving the lqr algebraic riccati equation a comprehensive simulation study is carried out to verify the proposed algorithms syed ali asad rizvi zongli lin

The considered systems are modeled via multiple modes, namely, fault-free case and faulty cases. Actuator stuck faults, including outage cases, are considered. With the aid of the finite-frequency positive-realness approach, a new linear-matrix-inequality-based fault detection method for control systems is obtained and applied to fault detection for flight control systems.

Our solution is based on the exploitation of a key separability property of the problem, that enables an efficient computation of the optimal controller by solving a small number of uncoupled standard Riccati equations. Our approach gives important insight into the structure of optimal controllers, such as degree bounds that depend on the structure of the poset. A novel element in our state-space characterization of the controller is a remarkable pair of transfer functions, that belong to the incidence algebra of the poset, are inverses of each other, and are intimately related to estimation of the state along the different paths on the poset.","Parikshit Shah, P.

state feedback,Multiuser MIMO Achievable Rates With Downlink Training and Channel State Feedback,"In this paper, we consider a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) fading broadcast channel and compute achievable ergodic rates when channel state information (CSI) is acquired at the receivers via downlink training and it is provided to the transmitter by channel state feedback. Unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel state feedback schemes are analyzed and compared under various assumptions. Digital feedback is shown to be potentially superior when the feedback channel uses per channel state coefficient is larger than 1. Also, we show that by proper design of the digital feedback link, errors in the feedback have a minor effect even if simple uncoded modulation is used on the feedback channel. We discuss first the case of an unfaded additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) feedback channel with orthogonal access and then the case of fading MIMO multiple access (MIMO-MAC). We show that by exploiting the MIMO-MAC nature of the uplink channel, a much better scaling of the feedback channel resource with the number of base station (BS) antennas can be achieved. Finally, for the case of delayed feedback, we show that in the realistic case where the fading process has (normalized) maximum Doppler frequency shift 0 ¿ F < 1/2, a fraction 1 - 2F of the optimal multiplexing gain is achievable. The general conclusion of this work is that very significant downlink throughput is achievable with simple and efficient channel state feedback, provided that the feedback link is properly designed.","G.

state feedback,Interference Alignment with Analog Channel State Feedback,"Interference alignment (IA) is a multiplexing gain optimal transmission strategy for the interference channel. While the achieved sum rate with IA is much higher than previously thought possible, the improvement comes at the cost of requiring network channel state information at the transmitters. This can be achieved by explicit feedback, a flexible yet potentially costly approach that incurs large overhead. In this paper we propose analog feedback as an alternative to limited feedback or reciprocity based alignment. We show that the full multiplexing gain observed with perfect channel knowledge is preserved by analog feedback and that the mean loss in sum rate is bounded by a constant when signal-to-noise ratio is comparable in both forward and feedback channels. When signal-to-noise ratios are not quite symmetric, a fraction of the multiplexing gain is achieved. We consider the overhead of training and feedback and use this framework to numerically optimize the system's effective throughput. We present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of IA with analog feedback, verify our theoretical analysis, and extend our conclusions on optimal training and feedback length.","Omar El Ayach, R.

state feedback,REDQUEEN: Fuzzing with Input-to-State Correspondence,"—Automated software testing based on fuzzing has experienced a revival in recent years. Especially feedback-driven fuzzing has become well-known for its ability to efﬁciently perform randomized testing with limited input corpora. Despite a lot of progress, two common problems are magic numbers and (nested) checksums. Computationally expensive methods such as taint tracking and symbolic execution are typically used to overcome such roadblocks. Unfortunately, such methods often require access to source code, a rather precise description of the environment (e.g., behavior of library calls or the underlying OS), or the exact semantics of the platform’s instruction set. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, yet very effective alternative to taint tracking and symbolic execution to facilitate and optimize state-of-the-art feedback fuzzing that easily scales to large binary applications and unknown environments. We observe that during the execution of a given program, parts of the input often end up directly (i.e., nearly unmodiﬁed) in the program state. This input-to-state correspondence can be exploited to create a robust method to overcome common fuzzing roadblocks in a highly effective and efﬁcient manner. Our prototype implementation, called R EDQUEEN , is able to solve magic bytes and (nested) checksum tests automatically for a given binary executable. Additionally, we show that our techniques outperform various state-of-the-art tools on a wide variety of targets across different privilege levels (kernel-space and userland) with no platform-speciﬁc code. R EDQUEEN is the ﬁrst method to ﬁnd more than 100% of the bugs planted in L AVA -M across all targets. Furthermore, we were able to discover 65 new bugs and obtained 16 CVEs in multiple programs and OS kernel drivers. Finally, our evaluation demonstrates that R EDQUEEN is fast, widely applicable and outperforms concurrent approaches by up to three orders of magnitude.","Cornelius Aschermann, Sergej Schumilo, Tim Blazytko, R.

state feedback,Global Output Feedback Stabilization of a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Measurement Sensitivity,"This note investigates the problem of global output feedback stabilization for a class of nonlinear systems with unknown measurement sensitivity. A new design method, namely dual-domination approach, is proposed to explicitly construct a state observer as well as an output feedback control law, which globally asymptotically stabilizes the nonlinear systems. The novelty of this note owes to a distinct perspective in coping with unknown measurement sensitivity which has previously been a hurdle to solve the global output feedback stabilization problem of the nonlinear systems.","Chih‐Chiang Chen, Chunjiang Qian, Zong-yao Sun, Yew-Wen Liang",2018.0,156,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c2776fafc3313dd2d7c45931c40d1496cfe1343,0.9520000000000017,0.0012676743052169675,state feedback global output feedback stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems with unknown measurement sensitivity this note investigates the problem of global output feedback stabilization for a class of nonlinear systems with unknown measurement sensitivity a new design method namely dualdomination approach is proposed to explicitly construct a state observer as well as an output feedback control law which globally asymptotically stabilizes the nonlinear systems the novelty of this note owes to a distinct perspective in coping with unknown measurement sensitivity which has previously been a hurdle to solve the global output feedback stabilization problem of the nonlinear systems chihchiang chen chunjiang qian zongyao sun yewwen liang

state feedback,Channel state feedback schemes for multiuser MIMO-OFDM downlink,"Channel state feedback schemes for the MIMO broadcast downlink have been widely studied in the frequency flat case. This work focuses on the more relevant frequency selective case, where some important new aspects emerge. We consider a MIMO-OFDM broadcast channel and compare achievable ergodic rates under three channel state feedback schemes: analog feedback, direction quantized feedback and ""time-domain"" channel quantized feedback. The first two schemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes. The third scheme is novel, and it is directly inspired by rate-distortion theory of Gaussian correlated sources. For each scheme we derive the conditions under which the system achieves full multiplexing gain. The key difference with respect to the widely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the frequency domain channel transfer function is a Gaussian correlated source. The new time-domain quantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation structure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler to implement than complicated spherical vector quantization. In particular, we observe that no structured codebook design and vector quantization is actually needed for efficient channel state information feedback.","H. Shirani-Mehr, G.

state feedback,Punishment and inspection for governing the commons in a feedback-evolving game,"Utilizing common resources is always a dilemma for community members. While cooperator players restrain themselves and consider the proper state of resources, defectors demand more than their supposed share for a higher payoff. To avoid the tragedy of the common state, punishing the latter group seems to be an adequate reaction. This conclusion, however, is less straightforward when we acknowledge the fact that resources are finite and even a renewable resource has limited growing capacity. To clarify the possible consequences, we consider a coevolutionary model where beside the payoff-driven competition of cooperator and defector players the level of a renewable resource depends sensitively on the fraction of cooperators and the total consumption of all players. The applied feedback-evolving game reveals that beside a delicately adjusted punishment it is also fundamental that cooperators should pay special attention to the growing capacity of renewable resources. Otherwise, even the usage of tough punishment cannot save the community from an undesired end.","Xiaojie Chen, A. Szolnoki",2018.0,147,PLoS Comput.

nonlinear control,Nonlinear control of transcription through enhancer–promoter interactions,"Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1–4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer–promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation. The transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship, and enhancer strength determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation.","J.

nonlinear control,DC Shipboard Microgrids With Constant Power Loads: A Review of Advanced Nonlinear Control Strategies and Stabilization Techniques,"In modern dc shipboard microgrid (SMG) systems, the propulsion motors and hotel loads are always supplied through tightly regulated point of load converters, which behave as constant power loads (CPLs). The negative incremental impedance due to CPL’s characteristics destabilizes the dc bus voltage of dc SMGs. Due to uncertain operating conditions of maritime ships on the sea, the dc bus voltage robust control is a crucial matter. Therefore, this paper presents a cutting-edge systematic review on advanced nonlinear control strategies to stabilize and control the CPLs in dc SMGs, such as sliding mode control, synergetic control, backstepping control, model predictive control, and passivity-based control. The latest stabilization techniques and the future trends towards an adaptive nonlinear control have been presented throughout this review.

nonlinear control,Meta-Adaptive Nonlinear Control: Theory and Algorithms,"We present an online multi-task learning approach for adaptive nonlinear control, which we call Online Meta-Adaptive Control (OMAC). The goal is to control a nonlinear system subject to adversarial disturbance and unknown $\textit{environment-dependent}$ nonlinear dynamics, under the assumption that the environment-dependent dynamics can be well captured with some shared representation. Our approach is motivated by robot control, where a robotic system encounters a sequence of new environmental conditions that it must quickly adapt to. A key emphasis is to integrate online representation learning with established methods from control theory, in order to arrive at a unified framework that yields both control-theoretic and learning-theoretic guarantees. We provide instantiations of our approach under varying conditions, leading to the first non-asymptotic end-to-end convergence guarantee for multi-task nonlinear control. OMAC can also be integrated with deep representation learning. Experiments show that OMAC significantly outperforms conventional adaptive control approaches which do not learn the shared representation, in inverted pendulum and 6-DoF drone control tasks under varying wind conditions.","Guanya Shi, K.

nonlinear control,Event-Based Finite-Time Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems With Asymptotic Tracking,"In this article, an adaptive neural finite-time event-triggered consensus tracking problem is studied for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) under directed graphs. First, the unknown nonlinear functions of MASs can be approximated by neural networks. Then, a distributed adaptive event-triggered control scheme is proposed via command filter and backstepping technique. The newly designed control scheme cannot only circumvent the problem of the explosion of complexity, but also remove the singularity issue typical of conventional backstepping technique.

nonlinear control,Prescribed-Time Output-Feedback Control of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems,"We present prescribed-time output-feedback-stabilizing designs for stochastic nonlinear strict-feedback systems. We first propose a new nonscaling output-feedback control scheme to solve the prescribed-time mean-square stabilization problem for stochastic nonlinear systems without sensor uncertainty. In this case, compared with the existing results on stochastic nonlinear prescribed-time stabilization, an appealing feature in our design is that the order of the scaling function in the controller is dramatically reduced, which yields a simpler controller and with the control effort reduced. We then consider prescribed-time output-feedback control for stochastic nonlinear systems with sensor uncertainty. In this case, the new design ingredient is that a time-varying controller is designed to guarantee prescribed-time mean-square stabilization, different from the existing results where an adaptive controller is designed to ensure almost sure regulation (as time goes to infinity).

Two different approaches based on sliding mode control (SMC), i.e. the traditional SMC and integral SMC, have been considered in the present study. To experimentally validate the proposed control laws, an electrically-driven single-link flexible manipulator has been designed and fabricated.

Moreover, the prescribed-time controller is obtained in the form of continuous time-varying feedback, which can render all system states converge to zero within the prescribed time.

Different from functions which are necessarily known in the conventional finite-time control of nonlinear systems, the nonlinear functions can be completely unknown in this paper. By applying fuzzy-logic systems to approximate the unknown nonlinearities, a novel adaptive finite-time control strategy is proposed. However, due to the existence of approximation errors, the existing finite-time stability criterion cannot be used to analyze the stability of stochastic nonlinear systems.

nonlinear control,Mean-Nonovershooting Control of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems,"We present mean-nonovershooting tracking control designs for stochastic strict-feedback nonlinear systems. Compared with the existing stochastic nonlinear tracking designs, the advantage of our design is that arbitrary reference trajectories can be tracked “from below.” We first consider a special class of stochastic nonlinear systems where the diffusion terms satisfy the linear growth condition and the drift terms are in special triangular forms. A new controller is designed to guarantee that the mean of the system output can asymptotically track a given trajectory without overshooting while keeping all of the states mean-square bounded. In this case, an appealing feature in our design is that strict mean-nonovershooting tracking is achieved while the existing results on nonlinear systems with deterministic disturbance can only achieve practical nonovershooting tracking. Then, we design a new controller for general stochastic strict-feedback nonlinear systems to ensure that the mean of overshoot can be tuned to be arbitrarily small while all the states of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability. In this case, the new design ingredient is that our control gains are independent of the initial conditions of system states, and the initial conditions of derivatives of the reference trajectory. This is in contrast with the existing results on corresponding deterministic systems whose control gains heavily rely on these initial conditions.

nonlinear control,Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics for model predictive control in the low-data limit,"Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.","E.

nonlinear control,Periodic Event-Triggered Control for Nonlinear Networked Control Systems,"Periodic event-triggered control (PETC) is an appealing paradigm for the implementation of controllers on platforms with limited communication resources, a typical example being networked control systems. In PETC, transmissions over the communication channel are triggered by an event generator, which depends solely on the available plant and controller data and is only evaluated at given sampling instants to enable its digital implementation. In this paper, we consider the general scenario, where the controller communicates with the plant via multiple decoupled networks. Each network may contain multiple nodes, in which case a dedicated protocol is used to schedule transmissions among these nodes. The transmission instants over the networks are asynchronous and generated by local event generators. At given sampling instants, the local event generator evaluates a rule, which only involves the measurements and the control inputs available locally, to decide whether a transmission is needed over the considered network. Following the emulation approach, we show how to design local triggering generators to ensure input-to-state stability and $\mathcal {L}_p$ stability for the overall system based on a continuous-time output-feedback controller that robustly stabilizes the network-free system. The method is applied to a class of Lipschitz nonlinear systems, for which we formulate the design conditions as linear matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the scheme is illustrated via simulations of a nonlinear example.","Wei Wang, R. Postoyan, D. Nešić, W.

nonlinear control,Event-Triggered Output Feedback Control for a Class of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of output feedback control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with event-triggered input. The considered system contains not only unknown system parameters, but also general nonlinear functions that are not required to be globally Lipschitz, in contrast to most of the existing results in the area. Besides providing two different event-triggered strategies without input-to-state stable assumption with respect to the measurement errors, we propose a new way to encode and decode the event-triggered control signals to further decrease the communication rate. With our newly proposed encoding–decoding mechanism, each time when the triggering event is violated, only 1-bit signal, either 1 or 0, is rendered to transmit through the communication channel between the controller and actuator. Clearly, this signal transmission mechanism is more effective and consumes less channel bandwidth. Through Lyapunov analyses, it is proved that the boundedness of all the signals is ensured and the output signal can be regulated to a compact set around zero, which is adjustable.","Lantao Xing, C.

nonlinear control,A Computationally Efficient Robust Model Predictive Control Framework for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems,"In this article, we present a nonlinear robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for general (state and input dependent) disturbances. This approach uses an online constructed tube in order to tighten the nominal (state and input) constraints. To facilitate an efficient online implementation, the shape of the tube is based on an offline computed incremental Lyapunov function with a corresponding (nonlinear) incrementally stabilizing feedback. Crucially, the online optimization only implicitly includes these nonlinear functions in terms of scalar bounds, which enables an efficient implementation. Furthermore, to account for an efficient evaluation of the worst case disturbance, a simple function is constructed offline that upper bounds the possible disturbance realizations in a neighborhood of a given point of the open-loop trajectory. The resulting MPC scheme ensures robust constraint satisfaction and practical asymptotic stability with a moderate increase in the online computational demand compared to a nominal MPC.

nonlinear control,Koopman Invariant Subspaces and Finite Linear Representations of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems for Control,"In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace spanned by specially chosen observable functions. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves functions of the state of a dynamical system. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems. Choosing the right nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear reduced-order models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis by leveraging a new algorithm to determine relevant terms in a dynamical system by ℓ1-regularized regression of the data in a nonlinear function space; we also show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear observable subspaces in the design of Koopman operator optimal control laws for fully nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control.","S.

nonlinear control,Deep learning for universal linear embeddings of nonlinear dynamics,"Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings. It is often advantageous to transform a strongly nonlinear system into a linear one in order to simplify its analysis for prediction and control. Here the authors combine dynamical systems with deep learning to identify these hard-to-find transformations.","Bethany Lusch, J. Kutz, S.

nonlinear control,A simple and efficient algorithm for nonlinear model predictive control,"We present PANOC, a new algorithm for solving optimal control problems arising in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). A usual approach to this type of problems is sequential quadratic programming (SQP), which requires the solution of a quadratic program at every iteration and, consequently, inner iterative procedures. As a result, when the problem is ill-conditioned or the prediction horizon is large, each outer iteration becomes computationally very expensive. We propose a line-search algorithm that combines forward-backward iterations (FB) and Newton-type steps over the recently introduced forward-backward envelope (FBE), a continuous, real-valued, exact merit function for the original problem. The curvature information of Newton-type methods enables asymptotic superlinear rates under mild assumptions at the limit point, and the proposed algorithm is based on very simple operations: access to first-order information of the cost and dynamics and low-cost direct linear algebra. No inner iterative procedure nor Hessian evaluation is required, making our approach computationally simpler than SQP methods. The low-memory requirements and simple implementation make our method particularly suited for embedded NMPC applications.","L.

Συνεπώςτα συστήματα υπό έλεγχο που προκύπτουν με αυτή τη μέθοδο έχουν τη μορφή LPV συστημάτων που μπορούν να ενσωματώσουν στοιχεία κορεσμού, ασυνέχειες και χρονικά μεταβαλλόμενες δυναμικές. Η δεύτερη μείζων συνεισφορά της διατριβής είναι οι προτεινόμενοι μη γραμμικοί προβλεπτικοί αλγόριθμοι επίσης με τη χρήση συστημάτων LPV μορφής. Ο απλούστερος είναι ο Μη Γραμμικός Γενικευμένος Προβλεπτικός Έλεγχος (Nonlinear Generalized Predictive Control NGPC) ο οποίος σχετίζεται με τον δημοφιλέστερο των συναφών ελεγκτών γραμμικών συστημάτων τον ΓενικευμένοΠροβλεπτικό Έλεγχο (Generalised Predictive Control GPC). O τελικός προτεινόμενος προβλεπτικός αλγόριθμος ελέγχου, Μη Γραμμικός Προβλεπτικός Έλεγχος Γενικευμένης Ελάχιστης Διακύμανσης (Nonlinear Predictive Generalized Minimum Variance Controller NPGMV), μπορεί να προσαρμοστεί είτε στον NGMV ή στον NGPC. Όταν ο αλγόριθμος χρησιμοποιεί μόνο τη μορφή LPV για να προσεγγίσει το μη γραμμικό μέρος του υπό ελέγχου συστήματος, η λύση απλουστεύεται και στη περίπτωση συστήματος με περιορισμούς (constrained) καθώς και στην αντίθετη περίπ τωση (unconstrained). Επιπλέον αυτή η διάταξη έχει ελαφριά υπολογιστική υλοποίηση σε λογισμικό. Τρία αντιπροσωπευτικά παραδείγματα συστημάτων με διαφορετικά δυναμικά χαρακτηριστικά Bandwidth BW) και διαφορετικού τύπου μη γραμμικότητες επιλέχθηκαν για την αξιολόγηση των ανωτέρω αλγόριθμων. Τα τρία παραδείγματα είναι βασισμένα σε πραγματικές βιομηχανικές εφαρμογές εμπορικού ενδιαφέροντος. Το πρώτο παράδειγμα αποτελείται από ένα σύστημα βραδέων δυναμικών (small BW), πιο συγκεκριμένα αφορά την αυτόματη καθοδήγηση (auto manoeuvring) και δυναμική τοποθέτηση (dynamic positioning) θαλάσσιων οχημάτων. Η βασικές μορφές του αλγορίθμου εφαρμόστηκαν σε αυτό το παράδειγμα, πιο συγκεκριμένα η μορφές state space και LPV. Σε αυτό το σύστημα οι παραμετρικές διακυμάνσεις εί ναι αντιπρο σωπευτικές της μεταβολής των χαρακτηριστικών των διαταράξεων των κυμάτων (wave disturbances) οι οποίες προκαλούνται περισσότερο από τις αλλαγές της θαλάσσιας δυναμικής κατάστασης (sea state), παρά εξ αιτίας μη γραμμικής συμπεριφοράς. Ο σχεδιασμός του τελευταίου συμπεριλαμβάνει περιορισμούς ενεργοποιητών actuator constraints. Η δεύτερη βιομηχανική εφαρμογή (medium BW) αφορά τον έλεγχο πτερυγίου (blade pitch) καθώς και της ροπής γεννήτριας παράκτιας ανεμογεννήτριας 5 MW με τη χρήση του αλγορίθμου LPV NPGMV. Ο κυρίως στόχος σε αυτή την εφαρμογή ήταν η διατήρηση της παραγόμενης ισχύος στην ονομαστική τιμή (rated value) το οποίο απαιτεί διόρθωση των αιολικών διαταράξεων, συνεπώς ηταχύτητα του ανέμου χρησιμοποιήθηκε στο σύστημα ως κυμαινόμενη παράμετρος. Ο ελεγκτής LPVNPGMV σε αυτό το παράδειγμα αποτελείτο από ένα παραμετρικό μοντέλο του συστήματος που συμπεριλαμβάνει τη ταχύτητα του ανέμου ώστε η απόδοση του ελεγκτή να μεταβάλλεται κατά τη διακύμανσή της. Το σύστημα αξιολογήθηκε στατιστικά συμπερι λαμβάνοντας περιορισμούς ενεργοποιητών. Το τρίτο παράδειγμα (fast BW) αφορά τη σταθεροποίηση μιας ηλεκτροπτικής γυροσκοπικής συσκευής δύο αξόνων σε εφαρμογές παρατήρησης. Ο ελεγκτής σε αυτό το παράδειγμα υλοποιήθηκε και εφαρμόστηκε στο πραγματικό σύστημα σ ε περιβάλλον προσομοίωσης (Hardware in the Loop HIL). Λόγω περιορισμών των υπολογιστικών χαρακτηριστικών του ψηφιακού ελεγκτή εν σχέση με τις δυναμικές του συστήματος, μόνο η βασική μορφή του αλγορίθμου ήταν δυνατόν να υλοποιηθείβασισμένη στα μοντέλα state space. Ο κυρίως στόχος σε αυτή την εφαρμογή ήταν η βελτιστοποίηση της παρακολούθησης τροχιάς δια μέσω του σημείου μοναδικότητας Ναδίρ (ασυνέχεια). Και στα τρία παραδείγματα οι NGMV ελεγκτές επέδειξαν αξιοσημείωτη βελτίωση εν συγκρίσει με τους βασικούς ελεγκτές χωρίς τη χρήση προγραμματισμένων παραμέτρων ρύθμισης (scheduled gains) ή επαναδιαμόρφωσης (reconfiguration) κατά τη μετάβαση μέσω πολλαπλών σημείων λειτουργίας (operating points).",Πέτρος Σαββίδης,,0,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7040194d0ca94c27f3d7f9fb5304845b0ca7e54f,0.0,0.0,nonlinear control nonlinear control η διδακτορική δια τριβή περιγράφει προηγμένες τεχνικές μη γραμμικών ελεγκτών σε βιομηχανικές εφαρμογές διαφόρων χαρακτηριστικών αρχικά εισάγει τη έννοια του αλγορίθμου ελέγχου της μη γραμμικής γενικευμένης ελάχιστης διακύμανσης nonlinear generalised minimum var iance ngmv προσαρμοσμένο σε συστήματα διακύμανσης γραμμικών παραμέτρων linear parameter varying systems lpv αυτός ο συνδυασμός προσφέρει το πλεονέκτημα του ngmv στη κύρια του μορφή δηλαδή την αντιμετώπιση των μη αναγνωρίσιμων μη γραμμικών στοιχείων ενός συστήματος χαρακτηρίζοντάς τα ως ένα σύστημα εισόδου black box επιπλέον προσφέροντας τη δυνατότητα χαρακτηρισμού των μη γραμμικών στοιχείων μαλακής μορφής ως συστήματα εξόδου lpv συνεπώςτα συστήματα υπό έλεγχο που προκύπτουν με αυτή τη μέθοδο έχουν τη μορφή lpv συστημάτων που μπορούν να ενσωματώσουν στοιχεία κορεσμού ασυνέχειες και χρονικά μεταβαλλόμενες δυναμικές η δεύτερη μείζων συνεισφορά της διατριβής είναι οι προτεινόμενοι μη γραμμικοί προβλεπτικοί αλγόριθμοι επίσης με τη χρήση συστημάτων lpv μορφής ο απλούστερος είναι ο μη γραμμικός γενικευμένος προβλεπτικός έλεγχος nonlinear generalized predictive control ngpc ο οποίος σχετίζεται με τον δημοφιλέστερο των συναφών ελεγκτών γραμμικών συστημάτων τον γενικευμένοπροβλεπτικό έλεγχο generalised predictive control gpc o τελικός προτεινόμενος προβλεπτικός αλγόριθμος ελέγχου μη γραμμικός προβλεπτικός έλεγχος γενικευμένης ελάχιστης διακύμανσης nonlinear predictive generalized minimum variance controller npgmv μπορεί να προσαρμοστεί είτε στον ngmv ή στον ngpc όταν ο αλγόριθμος χρησιμοποιεί μόνο τη μορφή lpv για να προσεγγίσει το μη γραμμικό μέρος του υπό ελέγχου συστήματος η λύση απλουστεύεται και στη περίπτωση συστήματος με περιορισμούς constrained καθώς και στην αντίθετη περίπ τωση unconstrained επιπλέον αυτή η διάταξη έχει ελαφριά υπολογιστική υλοποίηση σε λογισμικό τρία αντιπροσωπευτικά παραδείγματα συστημάτων με διαφορετικά δυναμικά χαρακτηριστικά bandwidth bw και διαφορετικού τύπου μη γραμμικότητες επιλέχθηκαν για την αξιολόγηση των ανωτέρω αλγόριθμων τα τρία παραδείγματα είναι βασισμένα σε πραγματικές βιομηχανικές εφαρμογές εμπορικού ενδιαφέροντος το πρώτο παράδειγμα αποτελείται από ένα σύστημα βραδέων δυναμικών small bw πιο συγκεκριμένα αφορά την αυτόματη καθοδήγηση auto manoeuvring και δυναμική τοποθέτηση dynamic positioning θαλάσσιων οχημάτων η βασικές μορφές του αλγορίθμου εφαρμόστηκαν σε αυτό το παράδειγμα πιο συγκεκριμένα η μορφές state space και lpv σε αυτό το σύστημα οι παραμετρικές διακυμάνσεις εί ναι αντιπρο σωπευτικές της μεταβολής των χαρακτηριστικών των διαταράξεων των κυμάτων wave disturbances οι οποίες προκαλούνται περισσότερο από τις αλλαγές της θαλάσσιας δυναμικής κατάστασης sea state παρά εξ αιτίας μη γραμμικής συμπεριφοράς ο σχεδιασμός του τελευταίου συμπεριλαμβάνει περιορισμούς ενεργοποιητών actuator constraints η δεύτερη βιομηχανική εφαρμογή medium bw αφορά τον έλεγχο πτερυγίου blade pitch καθώς και της ροπής γεννήτριας παράκτιας ανεμογεννήτριας 5 mw με τη χρήση του αλγορίθμου lpv npgmv ο κυρίως στόχος σε αυτή την εφαρμογή ήταν η διατήρηση της παραγόμενης ισχύος στην ονομαστική τιμή rated value το οποίο απαιτεί διόρθωση των αιολικών διαταράξεων συνεπώς ηταχύτητα του ανέμου χρησιμοποιήθηκε στο σύστημα ως κυμαινόμενη παράμετρος ο ελεγκτής lpvnpgmv σε αυτό το παράδειγμα αποτελείτο από ένα παραμετρικό μοντέλο του συστήματος που συμπεριλαμβάνει τη ταχύτητα του ανέμου ώστε η απόδοση του ελεγκτή να μεταβάλλεται κατά τη διακύμανσή της το σύστημα αξιολογήθηκε στατιστικά συμπερι λαμβάνοντας περιορισμούς ενεργοποιητών το τρίτο παράδειγμα fast bw αφορά τη σταθεροποίηση μιας ηλεκτροπτικής γυροσκοπικής συσκευής δύο αξόνων σε εφαρμογές παρατήρησης ο ελεγκτής σε αυτό το παράδειγμα υλοποιήθηκε και εφαρμόστηκε στο πραγματικό σύστημα σ ε περιβάλλον προσομοίωσης hardware in the loop hil λόγω περιορισμών των υπολογιστικών χαρακτηριστικών του ψηφιακού ελεγκτή εν σχέση με τις δυναμικές του συστήματος μόνο η βασική μορφή του αλγορίθμου ήταν δυνατόν να υλοποιηθείβασισμένη στα μοντέλα state space ο κυρίως στόχος σε αυτή την εφαρμογή ήταν η βελτιστοποίηση της παρακολούθησης τροχιάς δια μέσω του σημείου μοναδικότητας ναδίρ ασυνέχεια και στα τρία παραδείγματα οι ngmv ελεγκτές επέδειξαν αξιοσημείωτη βελτίωση εν συγκρίσει με τους βασικούς ελεγκτές χωρίς τη χρήση προγραμματισμένων παραμέτρων ρύθμισης scheduled gains ή επαναδιαμόρφωσης reconfiguration κατά τη μετάβαση μέσω πολλαπλών σημείων λειτουργίας operating points πέτρος σαββίδης

nonlinear control,A geometrical approach to control and controllability of nonlinear dynamical networks,"In spite of the recent interest and advances in linear controllability of complex networks, controlling nonlinear network dynamics remains an outstanding problem. Here we develop an experimentally feasible control framework for nonlinear dynamical networks that exhibit multistability. The control objective is to apply parameter perturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that the former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework practically meaningful, we consider restricted parameter perturbation by imposing two constraints: it must be experimentally realizable and applied only temporarily. We introduce the concept of attractor network, which allows us to formulate a quantifiable controllability framework for nonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the attractor network is more strongly connected. We test our control framework using examples from various models of experimental gene regulatory networks and demonstrate the beneficial role of noise in facilitating control. Complex networks, including physical, biological and social systems are ubiquitous, but understanding of how to control them is elusive. Here Wang et al. develop a framework based on the concept of attractor networks to facilitate the study of controllability of nonlinear dynamics in complex systems.","Lezhi Wang, Ri-Qi Su, Zi-Gang Huang, Xiao Wang, Wenxu Wang, C.

Based on the obtained identification model, a maximum likelihood extended stochastic gradient algorithm is presented to estimate the unknown parameters. To make sufficient use of the observation data and improve the identification accuracy, we deduce a maximum likelihood (multiinnovation) extended gradient‐based iterative algorithm by using the maximum likelihood principle.

nonlinear control,Nonlinear photonic metasurfaces,"Compared with conventional optical elements, 2D photonic metasurfaces, consisting of arrays of antennas with subwavelength thickness (the ‘meta-atoms’), enable the manipulation of light–matter interactions on more compact platforms. The use of metasurfaces with spatially varying arrangements of meta-atoms that have subwavelength lateral resolution allows control of the polarization, phase and amplitude of light. Many exotic phenomena have been successfully demonstrated in linear optics; however, to meet the growing demand for the integration of more functionalities into a single optoelectronic circuit, the tailorable nonlinear optical properties of metasurfaces will also need to be exploited. In this Review, we discuss the design of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces — in particular, the criteria for choosing the materials and symmetries of the meta-atoms — for the realization of nonlinear optical chirality, nonlinear geometric Berry phase and nonlinear wavefront engineering. Finally, we survey the application of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces in optical switching and modulation, and we conclude with an outlook on their use for terahertz nonlinear optics and quantum information processing.

nonlinear control,Nonlinear Control of a Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Using a Two-Mass Model,"The paper presents a nonlinear approach, using a two-mass model and a wind speed estimator, for variable-speed wind turbine (WT) control. The use of a two-mass model is motivated by the need to deal with flexible modes induced by the low-speed shaft stiffness. The main objective of the proposed controllers is the wind power capture optimization while limiting transient loads on the drive-train components. This paper starts by an adaptation of some existing control strategies. However, their performance are weak, as the dynamics aspects of the wind and aeroturbine are not taken into consideration. In order to bring some improvements, nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback controllers, with a wind speed estimator, are then proposed. Concerning the wind speed estimator, the idea behind this is to exploit the WT dynamics by itself as a measurement device. All these methods have been first tested and validated using an aeroelastic WT simulator. A comparative study between the proposed controllers is performed. The results show better performance for the nonlinear dynamic controller with estimator in comparison with the adapted existing methods.","B. Boukhezzar, H.

nonlinear control,Two‐stage auxiliary model gradient‐based iterative algorithm for the input nonlinear controlled autoregressive system with variable‐gain nonlinearity,"This article focuses on the parameter estimation problem of the input nonlinear system where an input variable‐gain nonlinear block is followed by a linear controlled autoregressive subsystem. The variable‐gain nonlinearity is described analytical by using an appropriate switching function. According to the gradient search technique and the auxiliary model identification idea, an auxiliary model‐based stochastic gradient algorithm with a forgetting factor is presented. For the sake of improving the parameter estimation accuracy, an auxiliary model gradient‐based iterative algorithm is proposed by utilizing the iterative identification theory. To further optimize the performance of the algorithm, we decompose the identification model of the system into two submodels and derive a two‐stage auxiliary model gradient‐based iterative (2S‐AM‐GI) algorithm by using the hierarchical identification principle. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the 2S‐AM‐GI algorithm has higher identification efficiency compared with the other two algorithms.","Yamin Fan, Ximei Liu",2020.0,151,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c693dfcbe5932b31fab42f74ae153ea368f58a2,0.968,0.0012270437185112953,nonlinear control twostage auxiliary model gradientbased iterative algorithm for the input nonlinear controlled autoregressive system with variablegain nonlinearity this article focuses on the parameter estimation problem of the input nonlinear system where an input variablegain nonlinear block is followed by a linear controlled autoregressive subsystem the variablegain nonlinearity is described analytical by using an appropriate switching function according to the gradient search technique and the auxiliary model identification idea an auxiliary modelbased stochastic gradient algorithm with a forgetting factor is presented for the sake of improving the parameter estimation accuracy an auxiliary model gradientbased iterative algorithm is proposed by utilizing the iterative identification theory to further optimize the performance of the algorithm we decompose the identification model of the system into two submodels and derive a twostage auxiliary model gradientbased iterative 2samgi algorithm by using the hierarchical identification principle the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the 2samgi algorithm has higher identification efficiency compared with the other two algorithms yamin fan ximei liu

nonlinear control,Disturbance-Observer-Based Control and Related Methods—An Overview,"Disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) and related methods have been researched and applied in various industrial sectors in the last four decades. This survey, at first time, gives a systematic and comprehensive tutorial and summary on the existing disturbance/uncertainty estimation and attenuation techniques, most notably, DOBC, active disturbance rejection control, disturbance accommodation control, and composite hierarchical antidisturbance control. In all of these methods, disturbance and uncertainty are, in general, lumped together, and an observation mechanism is employed to estimate the total disturbance. This paper first reviews a number of widely used linear and nonlinear disturbance/uncertainty estimation techniques and then discusses and compares various compensation techniques and the procedures of integrating disturbance/uncertainty compensation with a (predesigned) linear/nonlinear controller. It also provides concise tutorials of the main methods in this area with clear descriptions of their features. The application of this group of methods in various industrial sections is reviewed, with emphasis on the commercialization of some algorithms. The survey is ended with the discussion of future directions.","Wen‐Hua Chen, Jun Yang, Lei Guo, Shihua Li",2016.0,2318,IEEE transactions on industrial electronics (1982.

nonlinear control,Spin and wavelength multiplexed nonlinear metasurface holography,"Metasurfaces, as the ultrathin version of metamaterials, have caught growing attention due to their superior capability in controlling the phase, amplitude and polarization states of light. Among various types of metasurfaces, geometric metasurface that encodes a geometric or Pancharatnam–Berry phase into the orientation angle of the constituent meta-atoms has shown great potential in controlling light in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. The robust and dispersionless nature of the geometric phase simplifies the wave manipulation tremendously. Benefitting from the continuous phase control, metasurface holography has exhibited advantages over conventional depth controlled holography with discretized phase levels. Here we report on spin and wavelength multiplexed nonlinear metasurface holography, which allows construction of multiple target holographic images carried independently by the fundamental and harmonic generation waves of different spins. The nonlinear holograms provide independent, nondispersive and crosstalk-free post-selective channels for holographic multiplexing and multidimensional optical data storages, anti-counterfeiting, and optical encryption. Metasurfaces offer an approach for computer generated holograms with good efficiency and ease of fabrication.

nonlinear control,Neural Lyapunov Control,"We propose new methods for learning control policies and neural network Lyapunov functions for nonlinear control problems, with provable guarantee of stability. The framework consists of a learner that attempts to find the control and Lyapunov functions, and a falsifier that finds counterexamples to quickly guide the learner towards solutions. The procedure terminates when no counterexample is found by the falsifier, in which case the controlled nonlinear system is provably stable. The approach significantly simplifies the process of Lyapunov control design, provides end-to-end correctness guarantee, and can obtain much larger regions of attraction than existing methods such as LQR and SOS/SDP. We show experiments on how the new methods obtain high-quality solutions for challenging robot control problems such as path tracking for wheeled vehicles and humanoid robot balancing.","Ya-Chien Chang, Nima Roohi, Sicun Gao",2020.0,339,Neural Information Processing Systems,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4350f9b0fb5c2fbe6791cab4990d42908358bed7,0.968,0.0027547537786445637,nonlinear control neural lyapunov control we propose new methods for learning control policies and neural network lyapunov functions for nonlinear control problems with provable guarantee of stability the framework consists of a learner that attempts to find the control and lyapunov functions and a falsifier that finds counterexamples to quickly guide the learner towards solutions the procedure terminates when no counterexample is found by the falsifier in which case the controlled nonlinear system is provably stable the approach significantly simplifies the process of lyapunov control design provides endtoend correctness guarantee and can obtain much larger regions of attraction than existing methods such as lqr and sossdp we show experiments on how the new methods obtain highquality solutions for challenging robot control problems such as path tracking for wheeled vehicles and humanoid robot balancing yachien chang nima roohi sicun gao

nonlinear control,Data-Enabled Predictive Control: In the Shallows of the DeePC,"We consider the problem of optimal trajectory tracking for unknown systems. A novel data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm is presented that computes optimal and safe control policies using real-time feedback driving the unknown system along a desired trajectory while satisfying system constraints. Using a finite number of data samples from the unknown system, our proposed algorithm uses a behavioural systems theory approach to learn a non-parametric system model used to predict future trajectories. The DeePC algorithm is shown to be equivalent to the classical and widely adopted Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in the case of deterministic linear time-invariant systems.

adaptive control,Adaptive Control for Singularly Perturbed Systems,"Singularly perturbed systems are a class of mathematical systems that are not well approximated by their limits and can be used to model plants with multiple fast and slow states. Multiple-timescale systems are very common in engineering applications, but adaptive control can be sensitive to timescale effects. Recently a method called [K]control of Adaptive Multiple-timescale Systems (KAMS) has shown improved performance and increased robustness for singularly perturbed systems, but it has only been studied on systems using adaptive control for the slow states. This article extends KAMS to the general case when adaptive control is used to stabilize both the slow and fast states simultaneously. This causes complex interactions between the fast state reference model and the manifold to which the fast states converge. It is proven that under certain conditions the system still converges to the reference model despite these complex interactions.

adaptive control,On Model-Free Adaptive Control and Its Stability Analysis,"In this paper, the main issues of model-based control methods are first reviewed, followed by the motivations and the state of the art of the model-free adaptive control (MFAC). MFAC is a novel data-driven control method for a class of unknown nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems since neither explicit physical model nor Lyapunov stability theory or key technical lemma is used in the controller design and theoretical analysis except only for the input/output (I/O) measurement data. The basis of MFAC is the dynamic linearization data modeling method at each operating point of the closed-loop system. The established dynamic linearization data model is a virtual equivalent data relationship in the I/O sense to the original nonlinear plant by means of a novel concept called pseudo-partial derivative (PPD) or pseudo-gradient (PG) vector. Based on this virtual equivalent dynamic linearization data model and the time-varying PPD or PG estimation algorithm designed merely using the I/O measurements of a controlled plant, the MFAC system is constructed. The main contribution of this paper is that the theoretical analysis of the bounded-input bounded-output stability, the monotonic convergence of the tracking error dynamics, and the internal stability of the full form dynamic linearization based MFAC scheme are rigorously presented by the contraction mapping principle; the well known PID control and the traditional adaptive control for linear time-invariant systems are explicitly shown as the special cases of this MFAC.

adaptive control,Adaptive Control for Systems With Time-Varying Parameters,"This article investigates the adaptive control problem for systems with time-varying parameters using the so-called congelation of variables method. First, two scalar examples to illustrate how to deal with time-varying parameters in the feedback path and in the input path, respectively, are discussed. The control problem for an $n$-dimensional lower triangular system via state feedback is then discussed to show how to combine the congelation of variables method with adaptive backstepping techniques. To achieve output regulation problem via output feedback, problem which cannot be solved directly due to the coupling between the input and the time-varying perturbation, the ISS of the inverse dynamics, referred to as strong minimum-phaseness, is exploited. This allows converting such coupling into the coupling between the output and the time-varying perturbation. A set of filters, resulting in ISS state estimation error dynamics, are designed to cope with the unmeasured state variables.

adaptive control,Robust Adaptive Control Barrier Functions: An Adaptive and Data-Driven Approach to Safety,A new framework is developed for control of constrained nonlinear systems with structured parametric uncertainty. Forward invariance of a safe set is achieved through online parameter adaptation and data-driven model estimation. The new adaptive data-driven safety paradigm is merged with a recent adaptive controller for systems nominally contracting in closed-loop. This unification is more general than other safety controllers as contraction does not require the system be invertible or in a particular form.

adaptive control,Adaptive Control Barrier Functions,"It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs while stabilizing affine control systems to desired (sets of) states subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by using control barrier functions (CBFs) and control Lyapunov functions (CLFs). In this article, we introduce adaptive CBFs (aCBFs) that can accommodate time-varying control bounds and noise in the system dynamics while also guaranteeing the feasibility of the QPs if the original quadratic cost optimization problem itself is feasible, which is a challenging problem in current approaches. We propose two different types of aCBFs: parameter-adaptive CBF (PACBF) and relaxation-adaptive CBF (RACBF). Central to aCBFs is the introduction of appropriate time-varying functions to modify the definition of a common CBF. These time-varying functions are treated as high-order CBFs with their own auxiliary dynamics, which are stabilized by CLFs. We demonstrate the advantages of using aCBFs over the existing CBF techniques by applying both the PACBF-based method and the RACBF-based method to a cruise control problem with time-varying road conditions and noise in the system dynamics, and compare their relative performance.","Wei Xiao, C.

adaptive control,An Adaptive Control Strategy for Virtual Synchronous Generator,"The adoption of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) has attracted wide attention because of the equivalent operating mechanism as a synchronous generator, providing a feasible scheme for the distributed generation connected to utility grid. However, the delivered power and frequency of the VSG may easily oscillate when the dramatic power fluctuation occurred in the distribution generation system. Fortunately, the oscillation can be damped though adjusting the rotating inertia and damping coefficient. Thus, to investigate the influences of parameters perturbation on the active power and frequency for a VSG, the small-signal model is derived and the dynamic performances are analyzed in detail. Then, based on the results of parameters analysis, an adaptive control strategy is proposed in this paper. And an optimal damping ratio can be maintained throughout the whole process of operation to suppress the oscillation of power and frequency. Therefore, the dynamic performances of the VSG are enhanced since the dynamic indexes such as the response time and overshoots are optimized. In the end, a prototype of single-phase VSG has been built and the proposed adaptive control strategy has been verified through experimental results.","Fei Wang, Lijun Zhang, Xiayun Feng, Hui Guo",2018.0,234,IEEE transactions on industry applications,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd6668980bd7407ce9af22665d3333bd7dded1d6,0.9520000000000017,0.0019015114578254512,adaptive control an adaptive control strategy for virtual synchronous generator the adoption of the virtual synchronous generator vsg has attracted wide attention because of the equivalent operating mechanism as a synchronous generator providing a feasible scheme for the distributed generation connected to utility grid however the delivered power and frequency of the vsg may easily oscillate when the dramatic power fluctuation occurred in the distribution generation system fortunately the oscillation can be damped though adjusting the rotating inertia and damping coefficient thus to investigate the influences of parameters perturbation on the active power and frequency for a vsg the smallsignal model is derived and the dynamic performances are analyzed in detail then based on the results of parameters analysis an adaptive control strategy is proposed in this paper and an optimal damping ratio can be maintained throughout the whole process of operation to suppress the oscillation of power and frequency therefore the dynamic performances of the vsg are enhanced since the dynamic indexes such as the response time and overshoots are optimized in the end a prototype of singlephase vsg has been built and the proposed adaptive control strategy has been verified through experimental results fei wang lijun zhang xiayun feng hui guo

adaptive control,Language control in bilinguals: The adaptive control hypothesis,"Speech comprehension and production are governed by control processes. We explore their nature and dynamics in bilingual speakers with a focus on speech production. Prior research indicates that individuals increase cognitive control in order to achieve a desired goal. In the adaptive control hypothesis we propose a stronger hypothesis: Language control processes themselves adapt to the recurrent demands placed on them by the interactional context. Adapting a control process means changing a parameter or parameters about the way it works (its neural capacity or efficiency) or the way it works in concert, or in cascade, with other control processes (e.g., its connectedness). We distinguish eight control processes (goal maintenance, conflict monitoring, interference suppression, salient cue detection, selective response inhibition, task disengagement, task engagement, opportunistic planning). We consider the demands on these processes imposed by three interactional contexts (single language, dual language, and dense code-switching). We predict adaptive changes in the neural regions and circuits associated with specific control processes. A dual-language context, for example, is predicted to lead to the adaptation of a circuit mediating a cascade of control processes that circumvents a control dilemma. Effective test of the adaptive control hypothesis requires behavioural and neuroimaging work that assesses language control in a range of tasks within the same individual.","D. Green, J.

adaptive control,Distributed Adaptive Control of Networked Cooperative Mobile Manipulators,"This paper deals with the networked control of loosely or tightly connected cooperative manipulators in charge of achieving a cooperative task that is specified by means of proper task-oriented variables depending on the full state of the system. Since the full state is not known to robots, a two-layer architecture is designed. At the first level, each arm controller runs a distributed observer that estimates the system state. At the second level, this estimation is adopted to compute the local control input as in the case that a central unit is available. In addition, since the dynamic parameters of the arms might not be perfectly known, the local control law is made adaptive in order to counteract this uncertainty. The designed solution is suitable not only for pure motion coordination tasks but can also be exploited in those cases where a closed kinematic chain is generated by multirobot object manipulation. In this situation, the objective is to both move the object and limit the internal stresses on it that, however, cannot be locally computed. To overcome this issue, the wrench exerted by each robot on the object is decomposed in an external component (contributing to the motion of the object) and in an internal component that is locally estimated and, then, regulated.

A distributed dynamic event-triggered strategy is first proposed, in which an auxiliary parameter is introduced for each agent to regulate its threshold dynamically. The time-varying threshold ensures less triggering instants, compared with the traditional static one. Then under the proposed event-triggered strategy, a distributed adaptive consensus protocol is formed including the updating law of the coupling strength for each agent. Some criteria are derived to guarantee leaderless or leader-following consensus for MASs with general linear dynamics, respectively.

adaptive control,Trajectory Tracking Control of AUVs via Adaptive Fast Nonsingular Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Control,"This article aims to develop an effective control method that can improve the convergence rate over the existing adaptive nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control (ANITSMC) method for the trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To achieve this goal, an adaptive fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control (AFNITSMC) method is proposed. First, considering that the existing nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode (NITSM) has slow convergence rate in the region far from the equilibrium point, a fast NITSM (FNITSM) is proposed, which guarantees fast transient convergence both at a distance from and at a close range of the equilibrium point, and therefore increases the convergence rate over the existing NITSM. Then, using this FNITSM and adaptive technique, an AFNITSMC method is designed for AUVs. It yields local finite-time convergence of the velocity tracking errors to zero and then local exponential convergence of the position tracking errors to zero, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the upper bounds of the uncertainties and disturbances. Compared with the existing ANITSMC method, the salient feature of the proposed AFNITSMC method is that it provides AUV dynamics a faster convergence rate. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed AFNITSMC method and its superiority over the existing ANITSMC method.","Lei Qiao, Weidong Zhang",2020.0,312,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6d2c6f13bf61f97d9f771c8987d5425dc72d1dc,0.968,0.002535348610433935,adaptive control trajectory tracking control of auvs via adaptive fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control this article aims to develop an effective control method that can improve the convergence rate over the existing adaptive nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control anitsmc method for the trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs to achieve this goal an adaptive fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control afnitsmc method is proposed first considering that the existing nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode nitsm has slow convergence rate in the region far from the equilibrium point a fast nitsm fnitsm is proposed which guarantees fast transient convergence both at a distance from and at a close range of the equilibrium point and therefore increases the convergence rate over the existing nitsm then using this fnitsm and adaptive technique an afnitsmc method is designed for auvs it yields local finitetime convergence of the velocity tracking errors to zero and then local exponential convergence of the position tracking errors to zero without requiring any a priori knowledge of the upper bounds of the uncertainties and disturbances compared with the existing anitsmc method the salient feature of the proposed afnitsmc method is that it provides auv dynamics a faster convergence rate finally simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed afnitsmc method and its superiority over the existing anitsmc method lei qiao weidong zhang

Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the network, forcing the network to memorize the information throughout all the layers. Instead, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned affine transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts.

adaptive control,Integral concurrent learning: Adaptive control with parameter convergence using finite excitation,"Concurrent learning (CL) is a recently developed adaptive update scheme that can be used to guarantee parameter convergence without requiring persistent excitation. However, this technique requires knowledge of state derivatives, which are usually not directly sensed and therefore must be estimated. A novel integral CL method is developed in this paper that removes the need to estimate state derivatives while maintaining parameter convergence properties. Data recorded online is exploited in the adaptive update law, and numerical integration is used to circumvent the need for state derivatives. The novel adaptive update law results in negative definite parameter error terms in the Lyapunov analysis, provided an online‐verifiable finite excitation condition is satisfied. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates improved robustness to noise compared to the traditional derivative formulation. The result is also extended to Euler‐Lagrange systems, and simulations on a two‐link planar robot demonstrate the improved performance compared to gradient‐based adaptation laws.","Anup Parikh, R.

adaptive control,Adaptive Neural Network Control of AUVs With Control Input Nonlinearities Using Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we investigate the trajectory tracking problem for a fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that moves in the horizontal plane. External disturbances, control input nonlinearities and model uncertainties are considered in our control design. Based on the dynamics model derived in the discrete-time domain, two neural networks (NNs), including a critic and an action NN, are integrated into our adaptive control design. The critic NN is introduced to evaluate the long-time performance of the designed control in the current time step, and the action NN is used to compensate for the unknown dynamics. To eliminate the AUV’s control input nonlinearities, a compensation item is also designed in the adaptive control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to prove the stability and performance of the proposed control law. Moreover, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control method are tested and validated through extensive numerical simulation results.","Rongxin Cui, Chenguang Yang, Y. Li, Sanjay K.

adaptive control,Mode-adaptive neural networks for quadruped motion control,"Quadruped motion includes a wide variation of gaits such as walk, pace, trot and canter, and actions such as jumping, sitting, turning and idling. Applying existing data-driven character control frameworks to such data requires a significant amount of data preprocessing such as motion labeling and alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture called Mode-Adaptive Neural Networks for controlling quadruped characters. The system is composed of the motion prediction network and the gating network. At each frame, the motion prediction network computes the character state in the current frame given the state in the previous frame and the user-provided control signals. The gating network dynamically updates the weights of the motion prediction network by selecting and blending what we call the expert weights, each of which specializes in a particular movement. Due to the increased flexibility, the system can learn consistent expert weights across a wide range of non-periodic/periodic actions, from unstructured motion capture data, in an end-to-end fashion. In addition, the users are released from performing complex labeling of phases in different gaits. We show that this architecture is suitable for encoding the multi-modality of quadruped locomotion and synthesizing responsive motion in real-time.","He Zhang, S. Starke, T.

adaptive control,Adaptive Event-Triggered Fuzzy Control for Uncertain Active Suspension Systems,"This paper studies the adaptive event-triggered fuzzy control issue for active vehicle suspension systems with uncertainties. Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is applied for considered systems. In the process of designing controller, a crucial problem, actuator failure, is taken into account. An adaptive event-triggered mechanism is adopted to economize limited communication resource. Compared with the traditional event-triggered scheme with a constant threshold, the adaptive event-triggered mechanism can save more resource effectively. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptive event-triggered fuzzy control approach is proposed to guarantee the desired performance. Meanwhile, suspension constrained requirements are also ensured. Finally, simulation examples are presented to testify the feasibility of the approach proposed in this paper.","Hongyi Li, Zhenxing Zhang, Huaicheng Yan, Xiangpeng Xie",2019.0,231,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bf3f2eb00f4ce60d944cc598e6a461e969df434,0.9600000000000009,0.001877133105802048,adaptive control adaptive eventtriggered fuzzy control for uncertain active suspension systems this paper studies the adaptive eventtriggered fuzzy control issue for active vehicle suspension systems with uncertainties takagisugeno fuzzy model is applied for considered systems in the process of designing controller a crucial problem actuator failure is taken into account an adaptive eventtriggered mechanism is adopted to economize limited communication resource compared with the traditional eventtriggered scheme with a constant threshold the adaptive eventtriggered mechanism can save more resource effectively based on lyapunov stability theory an adaptive eventtriggered fuzzy control approach is proposed to guarantee the desired performance meanwhile suspension constrained requirements are also ensured finally simulation examples are presented to testify the feasibility of the approach proposed in this paper hongyi li zhenxing zhang huaicheng yan xiangpeng xie

adaptive control,Active Adaptive Estimation and Control for Vehicle Suspensions With Prescribed Performance,"This paper proposes an adaptive control for vehicle active suspensions with unknown nonlinearities (e.g., nonlinear springs and piecewise dampers). A prescribed performance function that characterizes the convergence rate, maximum overshoot, and steady-state error is incorporated into the control design to stabilize the vertical and pitch motions, such that both the transient and steady-state suspension response are guaranteed. Moreover, a novel adaptive law is used to achieve precise estimation of essential parameters (e.g., mass of vehicle body and moment of inertia for pitch motion), where the parameter estimation error is obtained explicitly and then used as a new leakage term. Theoretical studies prove the convergence of the estimated parameters, and compare the suggested controller with generic adaptive controllers using the gradient descent and e-modification schemes. In addition to motion displacements, dynamic tire loads and suspension travel constraints are also considered. Extensive comparative simulations on a dynamic simulator consisting of commercial vehicle simulation software Carsim 8.1 and MATLAB Simulink are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed control, and to illustrate the improved performance.","J.
